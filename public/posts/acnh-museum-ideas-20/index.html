Some examples include using online tools to design concepts or designs, creating audio or video recordings of your ideas, and using technology to create 3D models or illustrations. Technology also has the potential to help creatives in other areas of their lives as well. For example, if you are a musician, you can use music software to create beats and songs, or use a computer program to make lyrics more realistic and personalizable.
