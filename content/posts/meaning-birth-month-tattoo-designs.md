The power of inspiration: How can we use it to our advantage?
Inspiration is one of the most powerful tools we have. It can help us come up with new ideas, take on new challenges, and find solutions to problems. However, how can it be used to our advantage? Here are five ways: 
1) Get inspired by your surroundings: Check out your neighborhood, visit museums, or even watch movies to get a sense for what inspires you. This can help you come up with new ideas for projects or products. 
2) Use inspiration to create things you love: If you’re a creative person, why not use your creativity to create things that you enjoy? Maybe you like making art or designing furniture, or you just enjoy spending time in nature. These activities can help give you an idea of what might inspire future projects.

The Three Types of Idea: What they are and how to get them
Ideas can be defined in many ways, but the three most common ones are: a thought, an idea for a story, and a plan of action. All three have important roles in sales and marketing. Here are three tips on getting your ideas off the ground: 
The first step is to come up with an idea for something that you care about. What are some things you’re passionate about? This can give you ideas for stories, products or services that share your values or appeal to people who share those same passions. 
The second step is to come up with an idea for a story that will capture your readers’ attention. What will make this particular story stand out from all the others on the market? How do you want readers to feel after reading it? Are you targeting a specific audience or group of readers?

How creativity can be used in your work.
Creativity is key in any workplace. Whether it’s creating new ideas for products or services, coming up with solutions to problems, or simply coming up with new ways of doing things, creativity is essential to a successful organization.
But what if creativity wasn’t just reserved for the creative minds of artists and creatives? What if it was used in every day tasks, too? How could creativity be used in your work if you want it to be effective?

One way to use creativity in your work is by using problem solving as a tool. By thinking outside the box and coming up with creative solutions to problems, you can help make your business more efficient and successful. And while using creativity in your everyday life may not sound as glamorous as being an artist or creative thinker, it can have major benefits at work.
