Creative thinking is a process that starts with the idea and then it's refined into a creation. It can be something as simple as an idea for a new product or just a new way of looking at an old problem. Sometimes, the creative process can involve working on different versions of the same idea until one comes to mind that you're inspired to produce.

Brainstroming: How does it work?
How do brains work? There is no one answer to this question as the workings of the brain are complex and still being studied by scientists today. But, according to some theories, brainstroming may play a role in some aspects of mental activity. Brainstroming is when thoughts or ideas rush through your mind quickly and without any thought process behind them. This can lead to a lot of thinking and problem solving in a short amount of time. In some cases, brainstroming can be helpful for quick bursts of creativity or for focusing on a task at hand. However, it can also be dangerous if used too frequently or without proper moderation. So, how does brainstroming work? Scientists donâ€™t really know for sure, but some theories suggest that it involves the release of chemicals from your brain in order to help you process information more quickly.
