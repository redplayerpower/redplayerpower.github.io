What is innovation and how does it differ from other types of creativity?
Innovation is a process of creating new ideas or products that solve a problem. It can come in many forms- from the invention of the telephone to the development of new drugs. 
One important difference between innovation and creativity is that innovation typically involves more than one person. In order to create something new, you need to come up with a solution that meets the needs of your audience and is unique to them.

But in some cases, taking such risks can actually backfire, leading to less innovation and more stagnation. Here are six examples of how big ideas can fail:

One of the biggest challenges faced by big ideas is that they often come from unique perspectives or points of view. This can be difficult to take on and even harder to understand, let alone replicate. In order for an idea to succeed, it needs to be seen as unique and valuable in its own right – not just by those who came up with it but also by those who will use it in the future.
