conclusion
This is the conclusion of an article on big ideas. 
There are many different types of big ideas, but this roundup provides a few key takeaways. First, big ideas can be helpful in problem solving and coming up with new ways to do things. They also can help us think outside the box and come up with novel solutions to problems we’re familiar with. 
 Second, it’s important to be able to articulate big ideas clearly and convincingly so that others will want to hear them. This is where creativity and speaking confidently comes into play. Finally, it’s essential to keep in mind that big ideas should only be used as a starting point for new thinking; they should not become our full-time job.

How can you get started with creative art?
Creative art is something that anyone can do, regardless of experience or skill level. All you need is a willingness to experiment and explore, and you can create something truly unique and beautiful. Here are a few tips to get started with creative art:
1. Find your medium. Whether you prefer painting, sculpture, photography, or any other type of art, find the medium that speaks to you and start experimenting.

2. Let go of perfectionism. Creative art is about expression and experimentation, so don’t worry about making mistakes. Embrace the imperfections and see what kinds of interesting results they produce.

3. Follow your instincts. Trust your gut feeling when it comes to creating art – chances are, if you feel drawn to certain colors, materials, or subjects, there’s a reason why.
