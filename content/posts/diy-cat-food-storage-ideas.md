Contemporary Inventions: The computer, the internet, 3D printing
Invention is the key to progress. It is what takes us from the horse and buggy to the automobile, from telegraphs to telephones, from mainframe computers to laptops. And it is what has given us 3D printing, a technology that has the potential to change manufacturing as we know it.
3D printing is an additive manufacturing process, which means that it builds objects by adding layers of material one at a time. This is in contrast to subtractive manufacturing processes like CNC machining, which involve cutting away material to create an object.

3D printing has been around for decades, but it has only recently become accessible to consumers and small businesses. Thanks to advances in 3D printer technology and the availability of affordable 3D printers, this transformative technology is now within reach of anyone with an idea and a bit of creativity.

The benefits of Innovation
Innovation is the process of creating new products, services or business ideas that are conceptually different from those currently in use. In order for an innovation to be successful, it must be novel, easy to adopt, and affordable.

Increased Economic Growth: Innovation can help businesses increase their profits by creating new products or services that are new and unique enough to draw in customers. By increasing competition, businesses can make more money while reducing their costs.

Improved Customer Service: When customers experience new products or services that are different from those currently in use, they may feel more satisfied with them. This will lead to higher sales and lower costs.
