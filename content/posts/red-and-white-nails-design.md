The history of AI: How has AI been developed over the years?
A key part of any AI development is understanding the motivations behind the work. This history can be broken down into three periods: the1950s, 1970s, and 1980s. The 1950s were a time when AI was in its early developmental stages; however, it wasn’t until the 1960s that advancements began to occur in machine learning. However, this progress was slowed by two factors: the Cold War and concerns about how AI could be used for harm. The 1970s saw significant advancements made in AI; however, these advances were met with backlash from some quarters as they were seen as being too advanced for their time. The 1980s saw a shift towards using AI for good; however, this shift was met with criticism from some who felt that AI had become excessive in its power.

The challenges of innovation: What needs to be done to make it successful?
Innovation is key to keeping businesses on the right track, but it can also be difficult to get started. Here are four challenges that need to be overcome in order for innovation to stay successful: 1) Lack of experience: Many businesses start out with little or no experience in their field. Without a good foundation, it can be hard to build on what has been done before. This often results in poor innovation and product development. 2) Poor communication: When trying to come up with new ideas, it can be difficult to communicate these effectively and efficiently. This can lead to problems such as miscommunication and confusion over what is being discussed. 3) Lack of coordination: In order for innovation to work well, it needs to be coordinated between different departments within a company. This can be difficult when there are different interests and goals at play.
