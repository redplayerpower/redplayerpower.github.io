Innovation: What is it, and how can it be used?
Invention Ideas

There are many ways to come up with new ideas, but one of the most common ways is through innovation. Innovation can be a result of anything that can make life better or easier, from improving on existing technologies to coming up with a new way of doing something. Inventors often come up with innovative ideas when they're stuck and need to come up with something that works or that's easier to do.

One of the best things about innovation is that it can help solve problems. Not all inventions are created equal, and there are different types of patents and trademarks that are used in the business world. Patenting an invention allows others to use your idea for free, so you can make more money off of it while still being able to keep some control over your work. trademarks are another way to get other people's attention and help promote your invention.

Implementation: What are the steps involved in developing a big idea?
When it comes to big ideas, implementation is key. In order to put your big idea into action, you'll need to have a clear plan and follow the steps involved in developing it. Here are some key things to keep in mind: 
1. Have a strong idea - before you can develop a plan for implementation, you need a strong idea of what you want your big idea to achieve. this may include laying out a clear vision or goal, answering key questions about what users would need and desires, and designing an MVP or Minimum Viable Product that showcases your concept. 
2. Develop an MVP - Once you have a strong idea of what your big idea is, it's time to develop an MVP or Minimum Viable Product that showcases it. This will help validate your hypothesis and get user feedback so that you can continue developing the product with greater confidence.
