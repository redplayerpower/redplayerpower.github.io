7 Tips for the Purpose of Creativity: What are some tips for using creativity effectively in your work?
1. Make a list of ideas. This can be done in any format, but a list of ideas will help you to get started.
2. Think about how you can use the ideas on your list. If you cannot come up with an idea on your own, think about what others have done and what they used to achieve their goals.
3. Draw inspiration from other people and things around you. Studies have shown that imitation is one of the best ways to learn something new. Look at things around you and see how they have helped someone else achieve their goals or reached their dreams.
4: Take action! No matter what creativity may seem like, taking action is always the best way to go towards achieving your goals! Start by thinking of ways that you can improve or take actions that will help your creativity become successful.

What are some common creative ideas?
Creative ideas can be anything from new ways of looking at an old problem to reinventing the wheel. Here are five creative ideas that come to mind when thinking about creative ideas: 
1. Use discarded materials to create something new. For example, if you have a bunch of old cereal boxes lying around, go through them and discard any that are too large or bulky to use. Once you’ve eliminated the big ones, start stacking these in different positions to see what kind of shapes and designs emerge.
2. Try a new approach to an existing idea. If you’ve been using the same recipe for years, try using a different type of flour or sugar in your baking recipes. This will give your baking recipes a bit of a fresh start and make them more delicious overall.
3. Take advantage of unused space.
