The role of technology in innovation: What advantages does it have?
Technology has a vast array of advantages in the innovation process, including making it easier to find and use ideas, leading to quicker decisions, and allowing companies to better track their progress. However, it can also be dangerous if not used properly. In recent years, there has been a growing trend of companies incorporating technology into their business processes in order to speed up the innovation process. Here are three examples of how this could be beneficial for businesses: 
1) Technology can help businesses track their progress more efficiently. By tracking the progress of an idea and comparing it against previous iterations, a company can identify any potential problems early on and address them before they become too big or difficult to solve. This allows businesses to make better decisions about where to allocate their resources and reduce wastage. 

2) Technology can help businesses assess the viability of new ideas.

Tips for creating unique and interesting blog posts: How can you make your posts stand out from the rest?
Creating interesting and unique blog posts is a key part of any online writer’s repertoire. There are a number of ways to go about this, but one way that can really set your blog apart from the rest is by using creative writing techniques. Here are some tips for trying out these techniques:
1. Start with a strong opener. Your first sentence should be intriguing and introduce your readers to the topic at hand.

2. Use verbs tense in your writing to make your words feel more alive. This will help keep your reader engaged and motivated to read on.

3. Think outside the box when it comes to plot points and ideas. Not all blog posts need an obvious solution, and instead, you can use them as a jumping off point for new storylines or characters for your blog post.
