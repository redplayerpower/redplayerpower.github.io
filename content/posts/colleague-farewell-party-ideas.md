Successful Invention Creation: After an invention is created, it must be tested and proven before it can be used in the real world.
Invention creation is difficult and time-consuming. After an invention is created, it must be tested and proven before it can be used in the real world.

However, if the invention is successful, then it must be taken to the next level and tested on a larger scale. This can take many months or even years.
