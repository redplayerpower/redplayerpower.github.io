Types of creativity: Visual, auditory, kinaesthetic, and gestural.
Creativity is a two-fold process. There are creative visual and auditory experiences, as well as creative gestural experiences. Gestural creativity refers to the ability to create unique or innovative designs through the use of gestures. Gestural creativity can be seen in artists such as Michelangelo and Vincent van Gogh, who were known for their innovation in artistry. Visual creativity is when an artist creates a piece of art by using their eyesight and vision. This can be seen in paintings such as Leonardo da Vinci’s Mona Lisa, Caravaggio’s The Nude Descending from the Cross, and Picasso’s Guernica. Artists use their eyesight to see what they want to create, and then use their imagination to make it real. Audiogenic creativity is when an artist creates a piece of art by using sound instead of sight.

As technology advances, we are starting to see the beginnings of a future where it will change our lives in ways we cannot even imagine. Some of the key changes that could occur include: 
1. Improved security and privacy - With more information available online, people are more likely to be careless with their personal data. This could lead to a rise in cybercrime, as criminals can use this information to steal from individuals or organizations. 
2. New ways of communicating - Technology has given us new ways of communicating which could have serious implications for our society and economy. For example, we could see a rise in virtual reality, which allows people to experience different worlds without ever leaving their homes. This could have important implications for the future of work and education, as well as how we interact with others online.
