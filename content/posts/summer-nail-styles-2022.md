Why certain types of creativity are more successful than others?
Creative ideas are a key part of any business or organization. They can be used in a number of ways, both for good and bad. Some creative ideas are more successful than others, and there are some factors that play into this success.
Some creative ideas that have been successful include the design of products, the development of new technologies, and the creating of new concepts. Other creative ideas have not been as successful, such as the development of products that are insensitive to user feedback or those that are poorly designed. It is important to consider what type of creativity is being attempted before making a decision on whether or not to pursue it.

When it comes to big ideas, there are two types: the great ones and the impossible ones. Great ideas are those that have the potential to change the world, but they also come with a lot of risk.

This is why big ideas need to be considered carefully before being implemented, just as with any other idea.
