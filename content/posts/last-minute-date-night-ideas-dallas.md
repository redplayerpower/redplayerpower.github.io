This can be done through brainstorming, creativity workshops, or even just spending time thinking outside the box. Creative expression can be found in all forms, but it typically requires more time and effort than other forms of expression.

History of invention: How has innovation been used throughout history?
Invention has been a key part of human history for as long as humans have been able to create something. This includes both the simple things like making tools or buildings, and more complex items like air travel or computers. Inventions have had a direct impact on the way we live and work, as well as the way society functions. 
Here are three examples of some of the most famous inventions in human history: 

1) The printing press was invented by Johannes Gutenberg in 1455, which allowed for the spread of literacy and knowledge across cultures. 
2) The Concorde class jet airliner was developed by British Airways in 1969, which made air travel much more affordable and practical.
