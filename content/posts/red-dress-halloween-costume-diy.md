10 New Storage Ideas to Help You Organize Your Home
New Storage Ideas to Help You Organize Your Home
There are a number of ways to organize your home, and one way is to add storage space. One idea is to add a few shelves to the wall behind your TV or in the corner of the room where you keep your books, movies, and music. Another idea is to use an old cabinet as a makeshift storage unit. You can hang clothes in it, put books on top of it, or put toys in it. A third idea is to create a small interior shrine to your favorite thing. This could be a pottery jar with one of your favorite pieces of art inside, a picture from your childhood that you miss dearly, or any other piece of memorabilia that makes you happy. If you have children, they can help you select items for the shrine. Another way to organize storage is by using bins.

What are big ideas?
In business, big ideas are the seeds of new business models and products. They can be anything from a novel idea to a radical change in how a product is produced. They can also be inspired by something that has worked before, or by something that someone else has tried and found to be successful. 
The key to getting your big idea off the ground is to have a clear vision for it, and then come up with specific goals and timelines for making it a reality. There are several ways to generate big ideas, including brainstorming with friends or family, talking with experts in your field, researching existing products or services, or reading articles on the subject. 

If you're not sure what kind of big idea you want to pursue, there are plenty of resources available to help you get started.
