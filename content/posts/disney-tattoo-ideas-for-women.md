How to get started: What should you do before starting any creative project?
Creative ideas are the lifeblood of any creative project. Before starting any creative project, it's important to have a grasp of what you want to create. There are many different ways to get started, but some things you should keep in mind before starting any creative project: 1) Know your target audience. What do you want your project to achieve? Are you looking to generate new ideas for clients or sell products? Knowing the target audience is key in getting started. 2) Be prepared for failure. Have you ever tried something and it didn't work out? Don't be afraid to give up. You can always try again later if the first attempt doesn't work. 3) Have a plan. A plan is key in making sure that your creative project goes smoothly and that you don't run into any problems along the way. 4) Be willing to grow and learn.

What are creative ideas?
Creative ideas can be anything from a new way of looking at an old problem, to coming up with a new business idea. Whether you’re brainstorming for your next project or just need a break from reality, creative ideas can help you get anything done. So what are some of your favorite creative ideas? Here are a few examples: 
1) Taking things one step further: When you come up with an original idea, don’t stop there. What could the world do with another perspective? Try taking something that people usually do and make it their own. This will give your idea more life and make it more unique. 
2) Breaking the mold: When it comes to business, there is no “safe” route when it comes to starting a company.
