Regionalism: How does regionality play into the definition and appreciation of art?
Regionality has long been a defining factor for appreciation of art. The idea that art should be appreciated in its entirety, not just within a certain area, is something that has been debated by artists and critics alike. Regionalism can play a role in this debate by providing an understanding of the artist's perspective. Regionalism also allows us to better appreciate different artistic styles and movements.
