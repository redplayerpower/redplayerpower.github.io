Why big ideas are important
There are a lot of things that go into creating great ideas. The right mindset, the right team, and the right environment all play a role in whether or not an idea becomes a big one. But one of the most important ingredients in any recipe is big ideas. Big ideas can help shift gears and open up new perspectives, make changes happen, and even create new businesses. Here are 5 reasons why big ideas are so important: 
1. They can change how we think about things. When you have a big idea it opens up new possibilities for perspective and thought. This can lead to different ways of looking at an issue or problem, which can then be turned into something better. 

2. They can drive innovation. Innovation is key to keeping businesses afloat and keeping people employed.
