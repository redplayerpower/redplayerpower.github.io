Types of creativity: How different forms of creativity can be used to create things
Creativity is a wide term, and there are many different ways to define it. Some people might say that creativity is the ability to come up with new ideas or solutions to problems. Others might say that creativity is the ability to perceive and express what you see in your world. Still others might say that creativity is simply doing something new and exciting. Here are three types of creativity: creative art, creative writing, and creative music.
Creative art can be used for a variety of purposes, from producing works of art to creating stories and songs. Creative writing can be used for personal journals or novels, while creative music can be used to produce soundtracks or sound poems. All three forms of creativity can be used in different ways to create things unique and memorable.

Innovation processes: How does an inventor go from idea to product?
Invention processes can vary significantly depending on the inventor's background and experience. Generally, an inventor will need to generate a number of different ideas in order to come up with a product that is new and exciting. This might include generating concepts for products, working on prototypes, or even coming up with new business models.
One important factor that will affect the invention process is the inventor's willingness to risk failure. If the inventor feels that their idea is too risky or if they do not believe that it can be turned into a successful product, they will likely not go ahead with it. In addition, the inventor's skills and knowledge might also be needed in order to create a successful product.
