The history and definition of creative art: Creative art can be defined as any art which is created with the intention to communicate a message or create a piece that has a unique aesthetic.
Creative art has been around for centuries, and has gradually evolved over time. Initially, creative art was only used for religious or spiritual purposes, but as time passed it became increasingly common to see creative art used in everyday life. Today, creative art is widely accepted and enjoyed by all. There are many different types of creative art, and each has its own unique abilities and benefits.
One of the most important factors in determining whether or not creativity is present in any given piece of creative art is the artist’s intention. If an artist is simply trying to communicate a message or create an experience that is enjoyable, then their work will likely be considered creative. However, if the artist is trying to create something that is new and exciting, then their work will likely fall into the category of creative art.

The impact of inventions: What people and businesses are doing with invented products now
Invention is a word that has been used for centuries to describe creativity and innovation. Today, it is used more specifically to describe the process of creating something new. Inventions can be from small ideas to revolutionary products. The impact of inventions on businesses and people is often difficult to measure, but there are a number of ways in which they can have an impact. 
One way in which inventions can have a significant impact on businesses is by providing new ways to make money. Businesses that use invented products more often find that they can make more money and do better with their products because they now have a solution that was not possible before. Additionally, businesses can find that they need to change their marketing strategy if they hope to catch up with those who have been using invented products for years. 

People also play a role in the impact of inventions.
