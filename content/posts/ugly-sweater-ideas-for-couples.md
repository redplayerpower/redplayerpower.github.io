Evaluation: What factors do you need to consider when evaluation your Ideas?
Creative ideas are a valuable component of any business. However, they can also be a challenge to evaluate and assess. There are many factors you need to consider when evaluating your creative ideas. 
One important factor is the quality of your idea. If your idea is low quality, it will likely not be accepted by potential customers or partners. You must also consider the feasibility of your idea- does it actually have a chance of happening? If not, you may need to rethink your pitch and make sure the idea has enough potential to overcome any challenges. Additionally, you should measure the impact of your idea- is it worth risking money and time just to bring it to life? Finally, you must determine whether or not people will actually use your idea- is it something that people would want in their business? If not, you may need to revise or remove its from consideration.
