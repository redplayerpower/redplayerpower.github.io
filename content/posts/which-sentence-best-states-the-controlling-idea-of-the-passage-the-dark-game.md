Creative ideas can be anything from new products to new ways of doing things. However, the most creative ideas come from the inside. People who are creative often have different ideas for things that they don’t even think about. When they come up with a new idea, they often have no idea how it will turn out but that doesn’t mean it won’t be creative.
