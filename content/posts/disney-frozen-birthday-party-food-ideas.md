What are the new ideas?
It is no secret that the world is changing, and that this change is happening in many different ways. Some of the most recent changes include the rise of technology, which has led to a new level of accessibility for people with disabilities. Other changes include the shifting sands of geopolitics, which have led to a more complex world order. And yet still others can be seen in shifts in social norms and behaviors, as people become more open to different ideas and lifestyles.
One important concept that has been growing in prominence over the past few years is inclusion. This concept has been barrinated by a number of events, from #MeToo to the Parkland shooting, that have raised awareness and asked society how it can embrace diversity while protecting safety and civil rights. Inclusion means understanding and accepting different perspectives, cultures, and religions while also considering each person’s unique needs.

Conclusion:
A new way of looking at the world is about to hit the market and it has the potential to change the way we live, work, and think. called "Non-Physical Reality" or NPE, this new understanding of reality is based on the idea that everything in the world is actually energy. This means that everything has a power and can be used to achieve things. It's a radical idea but one that could have big impacts on our lives if accepted.
