Conclusion: What are some potential applications of brainstroming?
Brainstroming is a type of meditation that has been found to have many potential applications. In one study, participants were asked to focus on a specific object for 3 minutes. After the 3 minutes had passed, they were given a letter grade based on how much attention they had paid to the object throughout the session. The study found that those who had practiced brainstroming were more likely to receive an A than those who did not. Another study found that brainstroming was able to improve working memory in younger adults. It was also shown that practicing brainstroming improved mood and cognitive performance.

Types of creativity: What are they?
Creativity is a critical component of any creative organization. Whether it’s a small business, an artist, or a team of creatives, creativity is essential to making anything happen. There are many types of creativity, but three that are most important to businesses and artists alike are visual, auditory, and kinaesthetic. 
Visual creativity refers to the ability to see something and create ideas based on that. This can be done through drawing or painting, but often starts with seeing the idea in your head and then coming up with ways to turn it into a reality. Auditory creativity comes from creating sounds and melodies based on what you hear. This can be done through music creation or sound engineering, but often starts with imagining how the sound could be used in an application or project. Kinaesthetic creativity refers to the ability to touch something and create ideas based on that.
