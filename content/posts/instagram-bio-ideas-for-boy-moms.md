Types of creativity: There are three types of creativity: Play, Discovery, and Invention.
Creativity is a wide term and can mean many different things to different people. To some, creativity means coming up with new ideas or concepts. To others, it refers to the act of creating something from nothing.
Invention involves coming up with a solution to a problem or completing an unfinished task. Play is another form of creativity where people are focused on experiencing new experiences and having fun.

All three types of creativity can have positive and negative effects on individuals and businesses alike. If you're looking for ways to increase your creativity, it's important to understand the reasons behind each type and how they can be used in your work environment.

The power of creativity: What does it mean to be creative?
Creativity is a state of mind, it's ability to think outside the box and come up with new ideas. People who are creative often have an idea for something that they don't know how to do but they get stuck on how to make it a reality. One reason creativity is so important is because without creativity, there would be no innovation in the world. It can be difficult to be creative at times, but with practice you can become one of the most creative people around.

How innovation happens
Innovation is not a one time event or process. It is an ongoing, continuous journey that starts with a thought and ends with a new product or service. Innovation is about taking risks and looking for potential solutions to problems. Innovation can be found in everything from the smallest details of how we interact with the world to the largest ideas in business.
