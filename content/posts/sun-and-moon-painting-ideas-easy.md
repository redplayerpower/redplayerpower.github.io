Ideas are everything. They can be helpful, or simply annoying. They can be what we think of when we think of something, or what other people might have in mind for us. Ideas can also be the starting point for new ideas, or the idea behind something we’ve been thinking about for a while but haven’t had the courage to bring to life.

The telephone: How it was invented and how it has changed
In 1876, Alexander Graham Bell was born in Edinburgh, Scotland. Inventor of the telephone, his most famous invention transformed communication forever. The first words spoken by Bell over his invention were “Mr. Watson–come here–I want to see you.” 
Just one year after the birth of Bell, the first practical telephone was invented by Philipp Reis of Germany. His device could transmit sounds but not intelligible speech. 

Bell continued work on Reis’s design and eventually created an improved version that could transmit speech. On March 10, 1876, Bell made the first successful call between two buildings in Boston. The following month, he received a patent for his invention.

When it comes to developing ideas, the key is to start with a good foundation and then build upon it. Here are some tips on how to take a good idea and make it great:
1. Do your research. Make sure you have a solid understanding of the topic or issue you're trying to address. This will help you create a more well-rounded and thought-out solution.
