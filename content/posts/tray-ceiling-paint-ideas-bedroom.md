Defining "big ideas"
What are "big ideas"? This is a question that has been asked throughout the history of education. The answer, however, is not always so clear.
One way to think of big ideas is as concepts that are essential for understanding a particular subject. For example, in mathematics, some big ideas include numbers and operations, patterns and relationships, and geometry and measurement. In science, some big ideas include energy and matter, waves and forces, and Earth and space.

The National Education Association's College and Career Readiness Standards also identify several big ideas in each content area. For example, in English Language Arts, the standards identify reading for knowledge and information; reading for literary experience; writing; speaking and listening; and language. In history/social studies, the standards identify civics and government; economics; geography; history;and social studies skills and methods.

Ideas are a great source of inspiration and can be used in different ways to improve someone's life. Sometimes, ideas can be used for good, such as creating a new idea for a project, coming up with a new plan to improve upon an old one, or finding a new way to do something. Other times, ideas can be used for bad, such as inventing a new product that no one will ever buy, or coming up with a plan to fail at something.

Introduce the topic of creative ideas.
Creative ideas are the core of what drives businesses and industries. They are what inspire people to come up with new products, services, and ways of doing things. Many businesses have creative departments or teams whose sole purpose is to generate new ideas.
There are a number of ways to generate new ideas. One is brainstorming, which is when a group of people get together and try to come up with as many ideas as possible, without judging or critiquing them. Another way is to look at what other businesses are doing and see if there’s something you can improve upon or do differently.

You can also try asking customers or clients what they would like to see from your business. Sometimes the best ideas come from the people who are actually using your products or services. And don’t forget about your employees!

The role of technology in innovation: What advantages does it have?
Technology has a vast array of advantages in the innovation process, including making it easier to find and use ideas, leading to quicker decisions, and allowing companies to better track their progress. However, it can also be dangerous if not used properly. In recent years, there has been a growing trend of companies incorporating technology into their business processes in order to speed up the innovation process. Here are three examples of how this could be beneficial for businesses: 
1) Technology can help businesses track their progress more efficiently. By tracking the progress of an idea and comparing it against previous iterations, a company can identify any potential problems early on and address them before they become too big or difficult to solve. This allows businesses to make better decisions about where to allocate their resources and reduce wastage. 

2) Technology can help businesses assess the viability of new ideas.

Innovation is the ability to change or improve something with no approved plan or model. It is the driving force behind the fastest growing businesses and industries. Innovation allows companies to achieve new heights, faster than if they had to follow a traditional plan. Innovation can come from any place in a company, but it is most effective when it comes from within the team that is responsible for developing and executing projects.
