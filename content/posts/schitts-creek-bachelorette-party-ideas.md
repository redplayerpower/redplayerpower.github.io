History of innovation:
Innovation has been a part of human history for as long as humans have been able to think about it. From the early civilizations that developed methods of making things that didn't exist before, to the modern day innovators who are constantly creating new ways to improve life and make it more efficient, innovation is something that has always been a part of our lives. And yet, there was once a time where innovation was practically nonexistent in most cultures. This was the era known as the Dark Ages.
The Dark Ages were an era in human history when creativity was almost non-existent and innovation was virtually absent. While some aspects of this time period did experience some form of innovation, such as new methods of farming or weapons, most aspects of society were either unaltered or slowly improving upon what existed before.

In his article "Brainstroming: How Our Nerves Play a Vital Role in Thought and Action," (published in the journal "The Journal of Neuroscience"), Dr. Konrad Lorenz, a professor at the University of Vienna, suggested that our brains are actually two organs working in unison. He argued that the two systems work together to form a brainstrom, or group of integrated circuits. This group is what allows us to think and act effectively.
