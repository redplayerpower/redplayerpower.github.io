Definition of creativity in the business world: How do creativity and business connect?
Creativity and business are intertwined in a lot of ways. Sometimes it's difficult to define what creativity actually is, but there is definitely a connection between the two. 
In the business world, creativity is often used as a synonym for innovation. Innovation is the process of coming up with new ideas or concepts that might not have been thought of before. In order to be successful, businesses need to be innovative in their approach to their product and services. For example, Apple has always been known for their innovative design and products. They are constantly inspired by new technology and how it can be used to improve people's lives. This allowed them to continue expanding their empire even after they were first introduced to the world. 

On the other hand, creativity also goes beyond just doing things differently or having novel ideas.
