Ideas for social media: How can we promote our products and services?
Are you looking to develop social media platforms that can help promote your products and services? Here are a few ideas for how to go about it. 
1. Start by creating a social media profile for your business. This can include a username, website, and phone number. Make sure to have a strong presence on all types of social media platforms, as this will be your main source of marketing reach. 
2. Use influencer marketing techniques to reach more people on social media. If you have an existing following of popular bloggers or other influential individuals, reach out and ask them to endorse your product or service on their blog or other online outlet. This will allow you to build trust with potential customers and increase the likelihood theyâ€™ll visit your website or give you feedback. 
3. Join relevant communities and forums relevant to your industry or target market.

The Creative Process: How do we go about being creative?
Creativity is a process that we go through every day when we make something new. It can be something as simple as coming up with a new idea for a painting, or as complex as coming up with a new way to market a product. The key is to keep things fun, and to remember that creativity doesn't have to come from the outside- in fact, often the most creative people are the ones who are the most comfortable with their own ideas. So how do you go about becoming creative? Here are some tips: 
1) Take time for yourself- While it may seem like every day is another opportunity to come up with an idea, it's important to take breaks occasionally. If you're always working on projects or thinking about your work, you'll start to feel overwhelmed and stressed. This can lead to negative feedback and decreased creativity.
