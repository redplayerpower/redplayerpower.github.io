What are some creative ideas?
Creative ideas can be anything from designing a cake to making a new movie. However, some of the most creative ideas come when people combine their creativity and ingenuity. For example, one person might come up with the idea of creating three-dimensional cardboard models of buildings. Another might come up with the idea of creating an artificial intelligence that can learn and innovate based on its experiences. And still another might come up with the idea of creating a computer game that is both innovative and challenging.

Creativity is what makes people happy. It’s the driving force that drives their dreams and ideas and gets them up in the morning to work. There are all sorts of different ways to be creative, and everyone has their own way of expression. This doesn’t mean that creativity is only expressed through art or music, though those are both often popular examples. Creative expression can also be expressed through cooking, gardening, playing video games or spending time with friends.

Invention ideas are everywhere
Invention ideas are everywhere. You just have to be open to them. Most people go through life without ever thinking about inventing something, but the truth is that anyone can do it. All it takes is a little bit of creativity and a willingness to think outside the box.
If you're looking for invention ideas, start by taking a look at the things around you that could be improved. What annoys you on a daily basis? What would make your life easier? Chances are, there are others out there who feel the same way and would love to use your invention.

Another great place to find invention ideas is by talking to people. Ask them about the problems they face on a daily basis. What do they wish they had that would make their lives easier? You may be surprised at how many people have great ideas for inventions but never act on them.

What are some creative ideas?
Creative ideas can be anything from new ways of looking at an old problem to taking the opposite approach to an existing idea and seeing what happens. Sometimes these ideas can come from simply thinking about something different and seeing what comes out. There are so many creative ideas out there it's hard to know where to start! Here are a few examples: 
1. Try a new perspective on an old problem. When you look at something from a different angle, often the solution is obvious but you may not have thought of it before. This is where creativity comes in – trying things that others may have thought of as impossible or not worth trying. 
2. Make something that no one has ever done before. Something that is different but also traditional or familiar enough so people can feel comfortable with using it.
