Materials: What do you need to get started?
When it comes to do-it-yourself projects, the options are endless. But before you get started on your next project, it's important to make sure you have the right materials. Here's a list of what you'll need to get started:
1. A good quality adhesive. This will be your best friend when it comes to DIY projects. Make sure to get one that will work well with the material you're using.

2. A variety of tools. Depending on the project you're working on, you'll need different tools. Some basic ones to have on hand are a hammer, screwdriver, drill, and saw.

3. The right kind of paint. Again, this will depend on the project you're working on. Make sure to get paint that is durable and will look good once it's applied.
