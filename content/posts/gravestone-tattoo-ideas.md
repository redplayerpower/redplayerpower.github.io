The Challenges of Big Ideas: What can be done to overcome them?
The challenge of big ideas is that they can be revolutionary, but also risky and time-consuming to achieve. Some things that can help overcome this challenge include developing a process for vetting and approval of ideas, as well as having a clear goal for the idea, both during its early stages and once it has been developed. Additionally, having a team of experts who can help with the development and implementation of an idea can make it easier to get the message out there and grow awareness around it.

The Future of Invention: What We Can Expect from Its explosive Growth
Invention is one of the most powerful tools humanity has at its disposal. It can solve some of the world's biggest problems- from developing new drugs to design new transportation systems. But as it grows ever more popular, innovation may also come at a cost. If scientists and entrepreneurs don't keep up with the pace of invention, they could lose out on key opportunities to make a significant impact on society.
That's why it's important for society to continue to invest in innovation- not just because it helps us solve big problems, but because it can help us create new ways of life that are better for everyone. That's what we should expect from Invention's explosive growth.

Types of innovation: Product, process, market, and technology
Innovation is a key topic in business. A product, process, market, and technology that are innovative can help a company achieve success. There are many types of innovation, and each one has its own strengths and weaknesses. Here are three examples: 
Product Innovation: A product that is new and different can help a company succeed. For example, Nike's "Champion" sneakers were revolutionary because they were the first shoes to use air pressure to keep the foot elevated during exercise.

Process Innovation: Processes can be innovative too. For example, Google's search engine was revolutionary because it used natural language processing to find relevant results quickly.

Market Innovation: The market can also be innovative if it is different from what other companies offer. Apple's iPhone was the first phone to sell in billion units worldwide.
