Business models: How do inventors develop their ideas?
Invention ideas are not always easy to come by, but they can be very valuable. They can help businesses of all sizes create new products or services that might not have been possible before. If you're thinking of coming up with an invention, it's important to think about how you would go about doing it. There are many different business models that inventors can develop their ideas in, and each one has its own unique advantages and disadvantages.
One popular business model for inventor development is the Prototyping Method. This approach involves creating a model of a product or service that will allow for feedback and modification until it is ready to be released to the public. This allows inventors to test their ideas before they even release them to the public, which can help them immensely in terms of refining their concepts and getting more feedback from potential customers.

Defining big ideas
There are a lot of big ideas out there. But what exactly are they? And how can we define them?
A big idea is an overarching concept or theme that is central to a work of art, literature, or philosophy. It is usually something that the author wants to communicate to the audience, and it can be interpreted in many ways.

One way to think of a big idea is as a symbol or motif that represents something larger than itself. For example, in the novel The Great Gatsby, the green light on Daisy Buchanan’s dock represents hope and possibility. In Shakespeare’s play Romeo and Juliet, the balcony scene is a symbol of young love and its potential for tragedy.

Another way to define a big idea is as an abstract concept that can be explored in different ways.
