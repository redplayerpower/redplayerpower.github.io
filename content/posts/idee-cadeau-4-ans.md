Big ideas are those that could have a significant impact on the world. They can be things that people have never thought of, or ideas that are relatively new and unexplored. Sometimes these big ideas are developed by teams of people working together, and sometimes they are created by someone who is just thinking out loud. Regardless of who came up with the idea, it is important to diffuse it and see if anyone else can come up with a better option.

What inspired the inventor to invent their particular invention?
Inventors often have a specific idea in mind when they come up with their invention. It can be anything from a new product to a new way of doing something. Sometimes, an inventor's idea is just too good to ignore. That's what happened to Northrop Grumman Aeronautics company founder Robert Northrop. He came up with the design for the first jet engine in the 1920s, but it wasn't until he patented it that he got his name recognition and fortune.

Patent protection: What are the different types of patent protection?
Patent protection is a type of intellectual property that helps to protect ideas and other creative works. There are many different types of patent protection, and each has its own benefits and drawbacks. Here is a list of the most common types of patent protection:
1) Patent for invention: This type of patent protects the idea behind an invention, rather than the specific products or services that are produced as a result. This type of protection can be helpful for businesses who want to protect their new ideas from potential competitors, but it can also be expensive to obtain.

2) Patent for trade secret: This type of patent protects a confidential business information, such as a recipe or design. This protection can be helpful for businesses who want to keep their secrets safe, but it can also be difficult to enforce.

The Importance of Being Creative: Why it's important to be creative when coming up with invention ideas.
Coming up with invention ideas requires a lot of creativity. After all, if you can't think of something new, you'll never be able to invent it.
But why is creativity so important when it comes to invention? For one, it allows you to come up with ideas that are truly original. And when you have an original idea, you're more likely to succeed because no one else has thought of it before.

Plus, being creative means that you're not afraid to take risks. And taking risks is essential when it comes to inventing something new. If you're not willing to take risks, you'll never achieve anything great.

So next time you're feeling stuck, remember that being creative is the key to coming up with invention ideas that are truly innovative and unique.
