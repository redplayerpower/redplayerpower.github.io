What is innovation?
Innovation is a process of change that occurs in any business or organization. Innovation can be defined as the ability to create new and better ways to do something. Innovation can also include the addition of new ideas, products, services, or even business models. Every business has room for growth and innovation if done correctly. However, there are some steps businesses must take in order to achieve success with innovation.
One important step in achieving success with innovation is understanding your customers. You need to understand what they want and how you can provide it to them. Once you know this, you can begin developing innovative ideas that will help your customers achieve their goals.

Another step businesses must take is creating a positive customer feedback loop.
