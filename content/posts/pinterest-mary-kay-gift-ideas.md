Ideas are the lifeblood of any startup. They allow founders to think outside the box and come up with new ways to do things, which can then be put into practice and scaled. However, while ideas are important, they are not the only thing that startups need. They also need a clear plan, a good strategy, and a team who is reliable and supportive. These three components are what makes a startup successful.

Invention of the World Wide Web
In 1839, Nicholas-Jacques Conte wrote a paper on the idea of a world wide web, which would eventually be called the Internet. The first real steps were made in 1947 when Claude Shannon and others developed the theory of information theory, which allowed for the Transmission of Information over Communications Channels. The following year, IBM created an electronic computer called Punchy, which was used to test communication protocols on. In 1951, Xerox PARC developed the Alto computer system that could be connected to a network. On August 29th of that year, US president Harry Truman announced his plan to create the American National Telecommunications Commission (ANTC), which would control all federal telecommunications regulations. This was the beginning of what is now known as the Internet era.
