what is creativity?
What is creativity? It’s a question that has been asked throughout history, and one that still stumps us today. There are many definitions of creativity, but at its core, creativity is about generating new ideas.
It’s not just about coming up with crazy, out-of-the-box ideas (although that can be part of it). Creativity can also be about finding new ways to solve problems or approaching tasks in a different way.

So why is creativity important? For one, it’s essential for innovation. Without creativity, we wouldn’t have any new products, technologies or ideas. And in a world that’s constantly changing and evolving, we need to be able to adapt and come up with new solutions to keep up.

Creativity is also important for our mental health.

What is the best way to approach new ideas?
New ideas are always something to be taken with a grain of salt, but there are a few things that can help make them more palatable. One approach is to ask yourself what the potential benefits of the idea are. If you can find an example of how the idea could be used in your field or business, it can help make it more palatable. Another thing to keep in mind is that new ideas should not be taken lightly - if they seem too good to be true, they probably are. However, by taking a step back and investigating the potential benefits, you can form a better opinion of whether or not this is something that would work for you.
