How to turn creative ideas into reality
Creative ideas are a dime a dozen, but sometimes they can turn into something really great. Here are four tips to help you turn your creative ideas into reality:
1. Have a vision. Without a clear vision, it’s tough to put together an idea that will work. Make sure your idea is based on something you care about and have passion for.

2. Get feedback. Take the time to get feedback from people who know what you’re talking about. Not only will this help you ensure your idea is accurate, but it can also give you some great ideas to work with.

3. Make it simple and achievable. If it’s too difficult or challenging to come up with an idea, chances are it won’t be successful.

The telephone: How it was invented and how it has changed
In 1876, Alexander Graham Bell was born in Edinburgh, Scotland. Inventor of the telephone, his most famous invention transformed communication forever. The first words spoken by Bell over his invention were “Mr. Watson–come here–I want to see you.” 
Just one year after the birth of Bell, the first practical telephone was invented by Philipp Reis of Germany. His device could transmit sounds but not intelligible speech. 

Bell continued work on Reis’s design and eventually created an improved version that could transmit speech. On March 10, 1876, Bell made the first successful call between two buildings in Boston. The following month, he received a patent for his invention.
