The telephone: How it was invented and how it has changed
In 1876, Alexander Graham Bell was born in Edinburgh, Scotland. Inventor of the telephone, his most famous invention transformed communication forever. The first words spoken by Bell over his invention were “Mr. Watson–come here–I want to see you.” 
Just one year after the birth of Bell, the first practical telephone was invented by Philipp Reis of Germany. His device could transmit sounds but not intelligible speech. 

Bell continued work on Reis’s design and eventually created an improved version that could transmit speech. On March 10, 1876, Bell made the first successful call between two buildings in Boston. The following month, he received a patent for his invention.

Category: Creative Ideas
Creative ideas can be anything from the creative process itself, to how to go about creating something new. Whether you're looking for inspiration for a new quilt or a new painting, there are many ways to find creative solutions. Here are just a few examples: 
- Make your own puzzle book: This is an excellent way to get more out of your creativity and have some fun while doing it. Start by picking out some interesting puzzles to solve, then make your own book folder that holds the puzzles and their solutions. Once you've made one or two, take them around with you and show people what you've done! 

- Experiment with color: Just as with any other aspect of creativity, there's no one right way to do things. What works for one person might not work for another.

Definition: Creative art is any form of art that is not based on literal or historical reality.
Creative art is any form of art that is not based on literal or historical reality. This includes both expressively creative art and abstraction. Expressively creative art often uses creativity to escape from reality. An example of this would be a painting that doesn't represent a real-world object, but instead usesimagery or myth to create a unique experience. An example of an abstract artist's work could be a painting without any specific objects or movements, allowing the viewer to imagine what it might look like.
