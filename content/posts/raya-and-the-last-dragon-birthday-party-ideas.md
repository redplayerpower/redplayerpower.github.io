The role of technology in promoting innovation?
Technology has often been seen as a facilitator of innovation, with the ability to help organizations make faster and more efficient decisions. However, recent studies have shown that technology can also be used in an adversarial role, promoting innovation in the wrong direction. For example, Google was found to be using its search engine to promote its own products instead of those of other companies. In other cases, such as Apple's use of advertising to convince users to buy their products instead of competitors', technology can actually hinder innovation by creating a rift between different factions within an organization.
