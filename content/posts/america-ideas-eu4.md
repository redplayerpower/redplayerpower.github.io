Origin of Invention: How did somebody come up with the idea for an invention?
Invention is the process of coming up with a new idea or product that was not originally planned or conceived by someone else. It can be anything from building a new computer to creating a new type of sauce. Inventions have been around for centuries, but their origins are still unknown. One possible explanation for the birth of invention is that somebody came up with the idea in their head and then put it into practice. Another theory suggests that somebody else helped develop the original idea before it was put into action. Therefore, there is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question – each person’s experience and knowledge will likely differ on how they came up with the original product or idea.
