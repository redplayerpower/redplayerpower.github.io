Causes of creative destruction: The creative process and its various variables
Creative destruction refers to the ability of new technologies, ideas, and processes to change the way businesses operate and create new opportunities. In today's economy, creative destruction is more than just a trend; it's a reality.
While there are many reasons behind creative destruction, one important factor is the ever-changing landscape of technology. As new devices and platforms arrive, old ways of doing business are no longer enough to keep up with the new competition. Businesses must adapt or perish.

One example of this is music streaming services like Spotify and Apple Music. These services offer a unique way for listeners to access all types of music, from popular hits to obscure albums. While Spotify has been around for years and Apple Music was only released last year, both services have already made a name for themselves in the market.

This innovation is not limited to music either.
