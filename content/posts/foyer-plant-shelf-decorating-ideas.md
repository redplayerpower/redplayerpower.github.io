Invention is the process of coming up with a new idea, method or product that has not been invented before. It can be something as simple as coming up with a new way to make bread dough, or developing a new agricultural technology. In some cases, Invention can even come from scratch – someone comes up with an idea for a product and starts production. There are many sources of Inspiration for Invention, and it can come from anywhere in the world.
There are several reasons why people might come up with an Invention. Sometimes people have an Idea because they are frustrated with their current situation, or they see an opportunity that they haven't seen before.
