How do you come up with big ideas?
One of the best ways to come up with big ideas is by brainstorming. By thinking about possible solutions and possibilities, you can come up with concepts that may be even more interesting or challenging than what you currently think. Sometimes all it takes is some fresh creativity to inspire something new. So how do you go about brainstorming ideas? There are a few different methods, but the most important thing is to keep your ideas as accessible as possible so that everyone can contribute their own unique insights. Here are five ways: 
1) Take a walk around your neighborhood and see what local businesses are doing that could be applied to your city or town. This will give you a lot of potential inspirations for new ideas. 
2) Brainstorm with someone who knows more than you about a specific topic or problem.
