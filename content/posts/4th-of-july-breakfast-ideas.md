The challenges of innovation
Every business wants to be innovative. But how do you go about being innovative when you're small and new? The challenges of innovation are just as extensive as the opportunities. Here are a few tips to help you navigate them:
1. Keep your ideas open. When you come up with a new idea, keep in mind that there's always room for improvement. You might not have initially thought of it this way, but if your idea is good enough, someone else might eventually come up with a better solution or an even better way to do things. Be open to suggestions and feedback from others before you give your idea any serious consideration.

2. Don't be afraid to take risks. When it comes time to come up with a new idea, don't be afraid to take on whatever challenge seems daunting or even impossible at first.
