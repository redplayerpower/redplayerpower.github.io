Defining Innovation
Innovation is a term that is used frequently but often left undefined. This creates confusion when discussing innovation and can lead to misunderstanding its true meaning. When speaking about innovation, one must first define it in order to have a common understanding of the topic at hand.
Innovation is typically defined as introducing something new, whether it be an idea, method, or product. However, this definition does not capture the full scope of what innovation entails. Innovation often leads to change, which can be either incremental or radical. Incremental change is small and gradual, while radical change is more significant and happens suddenly. Both types of changes are essential for innovation to occur.

There are many factors that contribute to innovation. One important factor is a company’s culture.

The opportunities for big ideas:
There are endless opportunities for big ideas. In fact, many of the world's most innovative companies were started with just a single idea. And while it might seem daunting to come up with a truly groundbreaking concept, there are plenty of ways to get started. Here are four tips for generating big ideas: 1) Brainstorm with others. Collaborating with others can help spark new ideas and increase the chances of success. 2) Don't be afraid to experiment. Trying out new approaches often leads to breakthroughs. 3) Be open to change. Constantly adapting your approach will help you stay ahead of the competition. 4) Stay focused on the task at hand. If you lose focus, your ideas will quickly go away.
