Basics: What are the different creative ideas?
Creative ideas come in all shapes and forms, but they all have one common goal: to make a difference. Whether you’re looking to create an idea for your next project or just start thinking about new ways to improve your skills, there are some basic tips to get you started. Here are four quick ideas for getting started:
1. Take a walk around your city and think about what might be possible with different transportation options. What would a more efficient commute look like? What if the bridges and tunnels were repurposed as public art spaces? These are just a few examples of how creativity can be used in everyday life.

2. Make something using materials that you already have on hand. This could mean recycling materials such as old cans or cups, or finding new sources of inspiration from nature.
