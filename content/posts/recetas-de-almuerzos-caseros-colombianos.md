However, it's important to note that not everything comes from ideas. Sometimes, something has to be done before an idea can be a reality. This is where hard work comes in.

However, times have changed and now innovation can come from anything - technology, creativity or business acumen. Here are three Case Studies that illustrate why innovation is so important today:
