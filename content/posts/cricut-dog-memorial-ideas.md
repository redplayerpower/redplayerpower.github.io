Defining creativity:
In order to better understand creativity, it is important to first define it. Creativity can be defined as the ability to come up with new and original ideas. This could involve thinking outside of the box, being imaginative, and having a unique perspective.
Some people are more creative than others, but everyone has the ability to be creative in some way. There are many different ways to express creativity, such as through art, writing, music, and even problem-solving.

Creativity is often thought of as a rare talent, but with a little practice, anyone can improve their creativity. The next time you’re feeling stuck or uninspired, try brainstorming with a friend or taking on a new challenge. You may be surprised at the results!

The Pros and Cons: How do these new ideas compare and contrast with what is already known?
There are a lot of new ideas out there. Do you know what they all are? Let's take a look. 
One idea is to use technology to help improve education. Another is to create a more sustainable way of living. Plus, there are many more that have not been mentioned yet. So, how do these new ideas compare and contrast with what is already known?

One thing that is different about the new ideas is that they often focus on solving problems instead of creating them. This makes them better at solving problems that have already been solved before, rather than creating new ones from scratch. 

Another difference between the new ideas and what has been done before is that some of the old solutions may not be as effective anymore or may not work as well anymore in the modern world.
