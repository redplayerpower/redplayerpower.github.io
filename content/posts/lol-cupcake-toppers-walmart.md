Origins of Invention: The development of physical and mental abilities
Invention is a process of coming up with a new idea or solution to a problem. The first invention may have been something as simple as a new way to chop wood, but over time, the innovation and creativity of people have led to some amazing gadgets and technologies. One such example is the wheel, which was first invented by an ancient Egyptian man named Thoth. This invention led to the development of agriculture and subsequent growth in civilization.

Patent applications: What are the most popular patent applications?
Patent applications are one of the most popular types of patent filings. They are used to protect ideas and inventions that may not be protected by other types of patents, like trade secret protection. 
 There are many different types of patent applications, but the most popular ones include: 
-Patent application for a new product 
-Patent application for a process or structure 
-Patent application for an invention 
There is no set number of patent applications that are filed in any given year, but it is generally safe to assume that there will be at least one type of patent application filed every month. This makes Patents a very important part of any development team as they can protect ideas and inventions from being ripped off by others.

What is brainstroming and what does it do?
Brainstroming is a term that stands for the phenomenon of overflowing or overflowing thoughts or ideas. Brainstroming can be caused by either positive or negative emotions, but it typically occurs when thoughts and ideas are overwhelming and are not manageable. Brainstroming can be a difficult habit to break, but it can be done by thinking about and focusing on one specific idea or thought for a brief period of time.
