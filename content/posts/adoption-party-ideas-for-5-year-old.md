Defining "big ideas"
What are "big ideas"? This is a question that has been asked throughout the history of education. The answer, however, is not always so clear.
One way to think of big ideas is as concepts that are essential for understanding a particular subject. For example, in mathematics, some big ideas include numbers and operations, patterns and relationships, and geometry and measurement. In science, some big ideas include energy and matter, waves and forces, and Earth and space.

The National Education Association's College and Career Readiness Standards also identify several big ideas in each content area. For example, in English Language Arts, the standards identify reading for knowledge and information; reading for literary experience; writing; speaking and listening; and language. In history/social studies, the standards identify civics and government; economics; geography; history;and social studies skills and methods.

Conclusion
In the past few years, the idea of a virtual reality headset has become more and more popular. Some people use it for gaming, others use it to watch movies or TV shows, but most people are just getting started with this technology. 
One of the newest features of virtual reality headsets is that they can be used to create 3D experiences. This is where you take your normal physical world and make it look like it's in a different place or dimension. It's a great way to explore new worlds without having to leave your home.
