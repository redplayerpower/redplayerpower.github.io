The Benefits of Home made Projects: Why would you want to do any of these projects?
There are many reasons to do home made projects. Perhaps you have never created something from scratch before, or you are just looking for a new way to show off your skills. Whatever the reason, there are many benefits of doing your own projects. Here are just a few: 
1. Home made projects can be very cost effective: When you take the time to make your own projects, you can save a lot of money on materials and labor costs. For example, if you use simple cardboard and Sugru to adhere flooring instead of using nails or screws, you will save money in both the cost of materials and labor time. 

2. You can be creative and unique: by taking the time to create your own projects, you can be yourself and be sure that each one is unique.
