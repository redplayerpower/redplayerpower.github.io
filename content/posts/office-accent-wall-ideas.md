The basics: how to brainstorm effectively
Brainstorming is a technique that can be used to generate new ideas for a project or problem. There are a few basic steps to brainstorming effectively:
1. Define the problem or goal. What are you trying to achieve?

2. Gather a group of people together. Brainstorming is usually more effective with more than one person.

3. Generate as many ideas as possible. The goal is to come up with as many potential solutions as possible, no matter how “out there” they may be.

4. Evaluate the ideas and choose the best ones to implement. Once you have a list of potential solutions, it’s time to evaluate them and choose the best ones to move forward with.

Early Inventors and Inventions
Invention is a process of putting new ideas or objects into use. Inventions are often born out of necessity, as people try to solve everyday problems. But some inventions are created simply for the sake of novelty or fun. Early inventors made many important contributions to society, developing useful technologies that we still use today.
Some of the earliest known inventors include the Ancient Greek engineer Hero of Alexandria, who created the first steam engine, and Ctesibius, who invented the first water pump. In China, inventors developed paper and gunpowder in the 9th century. These inventions would have a profound impact on the world.

The Industrial Revolution saw a wave of new inventions that changed the way we live and work. Among these were the spinning jenny, which revolutionized textile production, and the steam engine, which powered factories and transportation.

Why big ideas are important
There are a lot of things that go into creating great ideas. The right mindset, the right team, and the right environment all play a role in whether or not an idea becomes a big one. But one of the most important ingredients in any recipe is big ideas. Big ideas can help shift gears and open up new perspectives, make changes happen, and even create new businesses. Here are 5 reasons why big ideas are so important: 
1. They can change how we think about things. When you have a big idea it opens up new possibilities for perspective and thought. This can lead to different ways of looking at an issue or problem, which can then be turned into something better. 

2. They can drive innovation. Innovation is key to keeping businesses afloat and keeping people employed.
