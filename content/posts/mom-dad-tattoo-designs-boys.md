what brainstorming is, how to do it
Brainstorming is a technique used to generate ideas for a project or problem. To brainstorm, you simply need to allow your mind to wander and come up with as many ideas as possible. There are no wrong answers in brainstorming, so don't worry about being too creative. Just let your thoughts flow and see where they take you.
To get started, find a quiet place where you can relax and focus on the task at hand. Then, set a timer for 10-15 minutes and start writing down whatever comes to mind. Don't worry about editing or critiquing your ideas at this stage; just let them flow freely. Once the timer goes off, you can start looking through your list of ideas and identifying which ones are the most promising.
