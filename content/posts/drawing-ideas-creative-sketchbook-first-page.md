Coming Up With Ideas: Offer some tips on how to generate invention ideas.
Inventing something new can be a daunting task, but there are some things you can do to increase your chances of success. First, try to come up with ideas that solve a problem you encounter in your everyday life. Chances are, if you can find a solution to your own problem, others will be interested in your invention as well. Also, don't be afraid to brainstorm with friends or family members; two heads are better than one when it comes to coming up with new ideas. Finally, keep a notebook or journal handy at all times so you can jot down any inventive thoughts that pop into your head; you never know when inspiration will strike!

What is big ideas?
What is big ideas? Big ideas are the seeds of creativity that can change the course of history. They come in all shapes and sizes, but they all have one thing in common- they are big enough to generate a response from the average person. Here are some tips on how to get started with big ideas: 
1. Define what you want your idea to achieve. This will help you understand its potential and potential danger. 
2. Look for examples of what has worked before. This will give you a sense for what other people have done that has helped them achieve their goals. 
3. Ask yourself a question: What if? What would it be like if this were to happen? This will help you determine whether or not your idea is really worth pursuing.
