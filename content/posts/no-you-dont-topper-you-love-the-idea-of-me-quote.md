Invention history: What inspired various inventors to come up with new ideas?
Invention history is a fascinating topic to explore, as it offers insights into the creativity and motivation behind inventors. Some of the most famous and influential inventors in history include Leonardo da Vinci, Nikola Tesla, Charles Darwin, and Marie Curie. Each inventor had their own unique ideas that led to new technologies and products. In some cases, these ideas were simply firsts – for example, da Vinci’s drawing of a three-dimensional image in paper was the first use of a technical drawing instrument in history. However, other inventions may have had more significant impacts on society or the economy. For example, Darwin’s theory of evolution led to the development of mass produced products like cars and machines. This theory also helped to change how people view themselves and their environment – thanks in part to his invention of the scientific method.

The power of thought: What makes great ideas?
Creative ideas come from all over, but some of the most popular ones come from thought.

Whether you're brainstorming a new product idea or coming up with a plan to save your company, it's important to have good thoughts in mind when coming up with new solutions. When you have these positive thoughts in your head, you're more likely to be able to see potential solutions and come up with the best one for your situation.
