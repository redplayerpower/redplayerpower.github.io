How is innovation used in the business world?
Innovation is a key component of business success, as it can help businesses improve their products or services, increase sales, and even create new markets. However, it can also be challenging to manage innovation effectively, which is why companies often rely on outside experts to help them work on projects. 
While there are many different ways that innovation is used in the business world, three main methods are structural, process, and product/service system innovations. Structural innovations help businesses change their symbols or branding to create a new standard in the industry. Process innovations can make it easier for customers to order or buy products online or through phone calls. Product/service system innovations can allow companies to improve the overall efficiency of their operations by making changes to their entire supply chain.

Winter weather: Tips to keep your home warm
If you're like most people, you probably think of winter as the time when your house is cold and unused. But that's not always the case. In fact, there are a few things you can do to keep your home warm during the winter. Here are some tips:
1) Keep your windows open at all times. This will let in natural sunlight, which will help keep your home warm.
2) Use a fireplace or heat pad. Fires add warmth to any space, and they also emit noxious gases which can help block out wind noise and cold air from coming in.
3) Place an electric blanket over every piece of furniture in your room. This will place an electric field between yourself and the elements, which will help keep you warm (or cooler) during the winter months.

How do you come up with big ideas?
One of the best ways to come up with big ideas is by brainstorming. By thinking about possible solutions and possibilities, you can come up with concepts that may be even more interesting or challenging than what you currently think. Sometimes all it takes is some fresh creativity to inspire something new. So how do you go about brainstorming ideas? There are a few different methods, but the most important thing is to keep your ideas as accessible as possible so that everyone can contribute their own unique insights. Here are five ways: 
1) Take a walk around your neighborhood and see what local businesses are doing that could be applied to your city or town. This will give you a lot of potential inspirations for new ideas. 
2) Brainstorm with someone who knows more than you about a specific topic or problem.
