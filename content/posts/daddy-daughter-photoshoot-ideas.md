Patenting andprotecting inventions
Patents protect inventions from being infringing by others. Patent applications are often filled out in a variety of different ways, including but not limited to, the following: 
-Inventor biography 
-Chemical formula 
-Description of invention 
-Problem to be solved 
-Steps and method for solving the problem 
-Grant of patent 
When an inventor fills out a patent application, they are typically taking on a lot of risk. They could potentially face lawsuits if their invention is copied or used without permission. To help protect their invention, many inventors choose to patent their ideas instead of just selling them outright. By filing a patent application, an inventor is able to make sure that their invention is protected from infringement and can also get feedback from potential customers or partners about how their product might work.

Evaluation methods
Evaluating ideas for inventions can be difficult. There are many factors to consider when trying to decide if an invention is worth pursuing. The first step is to come up with a list of criteria that the invention must meet. Once you have a list of criteria, you can start evaluating ideas against those criteria.
Some factors to consider when evaluating invention ideas include: market potential, patentability, manufacturing feasibility, and profitability. Other important considerations include: how unique the idea is, how much it will cost to develop and produce the invention, and whether there is a demand for the invention.

The best way to evaluate an invention idea is to consult with experts in the field. These experts can help you determine if an idea has potential and is worth pursuing. They can also provide guidance on how to develop and commercialize the invention.
