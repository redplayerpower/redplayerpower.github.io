The Invention of the Electric Shock guitar
Electric shock guitars were invented in the late 1800s by George Lukacs, a musician and inventor. Lukacs had been playing an electric guitar that used alternating current (A.C.) to create sound, and he realized that electric guitars could be used for amplification. In 1892, Lukacs developed his first model electric guitar, the Electric Guitar Company's "Lukacs Guitars." The guitar was designed to be affordable and easy to play, with a single-coil pickup and a simple design. In 1934, Lukacs died at the age of 83, but his electric guitar remains one of the most significant instruments in history.

The Different Types of Ideas: What are they?
Ideas are things that get your mind going and can help you solve problems. There are many different types of ideas, but these are the three most common:
1. The brainstorming idea: This is the idea that you come up with without anything specific in mind. It's just a thought or an idea that pops into your head.

2. The creative idea: This is an external perspective on something that you've already been thinking about or working on. It can help you come up with a new solution or approach to a problem.

3. The problem-solving idea: This is the mental construct that helps you see how everything works together to create a single goal or solution.

Creative process: How do artists come up with their ideas?
Creative process: How do artists come up with their ideas?
The Creative Art process begins with the artist’s idea. This idea can be something as simple as a thought or a plan, but it is important that the artist is able to come up with an interesting and unique solution to the problem at hand. After coming up with an interesting solution, the artist continues working on this solution until they have a workflow that they are happy with. The artwork then becomes a product of this unique workflow.
