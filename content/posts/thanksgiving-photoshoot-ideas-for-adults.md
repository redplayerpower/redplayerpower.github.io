Section 4: How to overcome creative blocks.
Nearly everyone experiences creative blocks at some point in their lives. For some people, it happens frequently; for others, more rarely. But whether you’re a professional artist or someone who just likes to dabble in creativity from time to time, it can be frustrating when you suddenly find yourself unable to come up with new ideas.
There are a number of ways you can overcome creative blocks. One is to simply take a break from whatever project you’re working on and come back to it later with fresh eyes. Sometimes all it takes is a little distance to see things in a new light and come up with the solutions you couldn’t see before.

Another way to overcome creative blocks is to brainstorm with someone else. Collaborating with someone can help spark new ideas and give you perspective on problems you’re having trouble solving on your own.

The benefits of innovation
Innovation is key to the future of many businesses and economies. It allows businesses to create new products, services and processes that improve customer experience,cut costs, or create new markets. Innovation also drives down prices for goods and services, making them more affordable for consumers. In the past, innovation was typically a result of technological advances or economic者 capitalism that allowed businesses to produce new products or services with little interference from government regulations. However, times have changed and now innovation can come from anything - technology, creativity or business acumen. Here are three Case Studies that illustrate why innovation is so important today:
