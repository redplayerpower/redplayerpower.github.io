How to Choose the Right Painting Scheme for Your Home
There are a lot of things you can do to “paint” your home, but it’s important to choose the right scheme for your needs. A few key factors to consider include: the size of your home, budgeting restrictions, and the style of your home. If you want an artsy home with lots of details or if you want a sleek, modern look, there are many different painting schemes available. Here are some tips on how to pick the best scheme for your home:
1. Decide how much space you want to dedicate to painting. A small home may not need as much room as a larger one, so decide what scheme will work best for you and your budget.

2. Consider how much light and shadow you want in your paintings. Do you need bright colors in every room?

What are big ideas?
When it comes to big ideas, there are many dimensions to consider. These can be broken down into four categories: problem, solution, opportunity and impact. 
Problem: How can we make our world a better place? 
Solution: There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question; each person's perspective and situation will dictate the best way to solve a problem. However, there are a few general concepts that can be used in order to determine what type of solution may work best for a given situation. One such concept is called the "Golden Rule." This states that you should do what is right, even if it doesn't make sense at first. 

Opportunity: What are the possible consequences of our actions? 

Impact: What kind of change or impact will our solutions have?
