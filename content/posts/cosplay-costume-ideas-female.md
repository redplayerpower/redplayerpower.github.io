What are some common ways to get started with ideas?
Ideas can come in all shapes and sizes, but they all have one thing in common: they're always ready to be used.

Here are five ways to get started with ideas:

Innovation is the process of coming up with a new solution to a problem. It can be defined in many ways, but one way to think about it is as a change in direction from the traditional.
