Solution: How can we do it?
One potential solution to the migration of large numbers of people is to provide easier and faster access to the necessary visas and entry into the United States. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has created a website that allows citizens of many countries, including China, India, and Russia, to apply for visas without having to go through a travel agent. This online system is known as the Visa Waiver Program. The program allows people from these countries to enter the United States for tourist or business purposes without first obtaining a visa. The website also offers information on how toapply for visas and what documents are needed in order to apply.

The drawbacks of brainstorming
There are many drawbacks to brainstorming. Brainstorming can lead to groupthink, which is when a group of people come up with ideas that are not very creative or innovative because they all think alike. This can happen because people in the group feel pressure to conform to the majority opinion. Another problem with brainstorming is that it can be very inefficient. A lot of time can be wasted coming up with ideas that are not good, and it can be hard to come up with new ideas if you are stuck on one bad idea. Finally, brainstorming can sometimes create conflict within a group because people may have different opinions about the best way to solve a problem.
