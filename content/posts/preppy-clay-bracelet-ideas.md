How to come up with big ideas: What tips do you have?
Big ideas are the lifeblood of any business. Without big ideas, businesses risk becoming stagnant or even failing. Here are a few tips to come up with big ideas: 
1. Brainstorm with others: Brainstorming is key to coming up with great ideas. Talk to your accountant, banker, or other important professionals about what you want to achieve. They can provide guidance on how to make your idea a reality. 
2. Use brainstorming tools: With brainstorming tools like Scrum, Kanban boards, and Venn diagrams, you can quickly generate potential solutions and understand the different aspects of your problem. 
3. Be open to change: Sometimes it’s best to be flexible when it comes to coming up with big ideas. Don’t be afraid to experiment and see what works best for your business model and product.
