Definition of innovation: How does innovation differ from traditional methods and technologies?
Innovation is a process of creating an new product, service or technology that is different from what has been done before. Innovation can bedefined as any change that makes something better or more efficient. Innovation can also bedefined as the ability to bring new ideas to market quickly and create value for customers. 
Traditional methods and technologies can also be called innovative, but they are not always the best options for how things are done. For example, a company might use a traditional way of doing marketing to get their product into people’s hands sooner, but this approach might not be the best option when it comes to creating value for customers.

How can we turn big ideas into real projects?
How can we turn big ideas into real projects? There are a few key strategies that can help. First, we need to identify the big idea. Once we know what it is, our next step is to develop a plan for how to make it a reality. Once we have a plan, it’s time to gather the resources necessary to make it happen. This might include money, manpower, or other resources that we can borrow from others or give away. If all of these resources are available, the next step is to put together a team of advisors who can help us achieve our goals. Finally, once we have achieved our goals and made progress towards our target date, it’s important to celebrating and measuring the success of our project in order to maintain motivation and accountability.
