Invention: What are the different types of inventions?
Invention refers to any new or unique product, service, process, or technology that is developed by an individual. This can be in the form of a new way to do something, a new recipe for a food, or a new way of looking at an issue. There are many different types of inventions and each has its own story and importance. Here are five of the most common:
1. Technology- A technological invention is any new invention that makes something easier or more efficient. For example, one example of a technological innovation is the development of vacuum cleaners that don't require electricity to work.

2. Food- Many inventions are based on recipes that have been around for centuries. For example, the crockpot was invented by accident when someone found out that cooking meat in a slow cooker couldn't get it to brown as well as they wanted it to.

Achieving Innovation through Creativity: How can creativity be used in order to achieve success with innovation?
Innovation is a key word in the phrase "creativity." Achieving success with innovation requires creativity as well as hard work and determination. By using creative ideas to solve problems, companies can improve their products and services while also becoming more innovative themselves. Here are some tips on how to achieve this: 
1. Draw on your own experiences and knowledge to come up with new insights. When you’re trying to come up with new ideas, it can be helpful to pens yourself a short list of possible solutions or concepts to get you started. This will give you something tangible to focus on when brainstorming, which can help make your ideas more viable. 

2. Get help from others.

Conclusion: Summarize the main points of the article.
A new invention is always something to be celebrated. It's a sign that progress is being made and that people are still coming up with new and innovative ideas. But what happens when an invention goes wrong? When it doesn't work as intended or, even worse, causes harm?
There have been plenty of examples throughout history of inventions that have had disastrous consequences. The atomic bomb is perhaps the most famous example. Invented during World War II, it was used twice in combat, resulting in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people.

Other examples include the Ford Pinto, which was prone to exploding if involved in a rear-end collision, and the Segway, which has been involved in numerous accidents and injuries.
