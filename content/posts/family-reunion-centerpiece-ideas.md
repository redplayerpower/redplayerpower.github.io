Are you struggling to keep up with the ever-growing pace of business? If so, brainstroming may be the perfect solution for you. Brainstroming is a technique used in business that helps you stay focused and organized. Here are some tips on how to do it in your own business: 
1. Set goals and targets.

When you start brainstroming, it’s important to have specific goals and targets that you want to achieve. By setting these goals, you can ensure that your brainstroming efforts are directed towards achieving these rather than just talking about it without actually doing anything. 

2. Find a way to track progress.

One of the best ways to track progress during brainstroming is by using a goal tracker such as Goalilla or MorningStar.
