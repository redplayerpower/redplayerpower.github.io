There are many invention ideas out there, and it can be hard to know which ones to pursue. Here are a few tips to help you make the best choices:

3. Try multiple methods of experimentation. You don't have to duplicate everything that someone else has done before you; instead, try different methods of experimentation and see which ones work best for you.

4. Get feedback from people who know your target market well.
