What are creative ideas?
Creative ideas are a powerful tool that can help you achieve your goals. You can find many different creative ideas online, and there are many ways to use them. Here are some of the best:  
- Creative packaging: Many people think that creativity comes when someone comes up with a new idea for a product or service. However, this is not always the case. Sometimes, creative ideas come from looking at something from a different perspective.

- Branding: One of the most important things that businesses do is to create brand equity. This means creating a name for your company and making it known to other businesses in your industry.

Big ideas are a common feature of any innovation, whether it’s in the business world or scientific research. They can be defined in many ways, but here are a few key points:

2. It must have significant implications for the world as a whole, and its potential solutions must be fully realized before it can be considered a "big idea."

3. There is typically no one-size-fits-all answer when it comes to developing a big idea, but some commonly used criteria include: novelty, impact/impactiveness, feasibility, and opportunity/opportunity cost.
