What are the benefits of coming up with big ideas?
When it comes to ideas, there are a number of benefits that come with creating them. From improving communication and team morale to coming up with new and innovative ways of doing business, big ideas can have a huge impact on both individuals and companies. Here are four reasons why: 
1. They can open up new possibilities: When a group of people have a good idea, it can be difficult to resist trying out what they've come up with. This allows for increased creativity as well as ingenuity, which can lead to new and innovative solutions. 

2. They can spark inspiration: Ideas are often based on something that someone else has already done or experienced.

Origins of creativity: The origin of creative thought is unknown, but it likely has something to do with mental stimulation and the need for novelty.
There is debate over the origins of creativity, but there is no doubt that it has something to do with mental stimulation and the need for novelty. While scientists are still working to unlock the secrets of creativity, it is likely that its origins lie in some form of mental stimulation. This can be found in things like reading, art, and music.
