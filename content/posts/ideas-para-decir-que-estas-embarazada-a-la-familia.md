Brainstorming is a method of ideation in which a group of people generate creative ideas and solutions through intensive and freewheeling discussion. The term was first coined in the 1930s by Alex Faickney Osborn, an advertising executive, who developed it as a means to stimulate the creative thinking of his employees. Brainstorming has since been adopted by businesses, organizations, and individuals as a way to generate new ideas and solve problems.
