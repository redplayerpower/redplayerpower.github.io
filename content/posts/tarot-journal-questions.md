Conclusion: How does innovation help businesses grow?
Innovation has been a key factor in businesses growing over the years. By using innovative methods and technologies, businesses can improve their products and services while also cutting costs. However, there are some risks involved with innovation, which can impact business growth. One risk is that it can lead to a rise in costs or a decrease in sales. Another risk is that it can lead to changes in the way people feel about a product or service, which could make customers less likely to buy from a business.

Conclusion: Some ways to come up with creative ideas.
Creative ideas are aplenty, but sometimes they don't come easy. You have to be willing to think outside the box and come up with new ways to do things. Here are some ways to come up with creative ideas: 
1. Take on a new project: This can be something as small as creating a new design for your business cards or as large as starting your own business. It doesn't have to be anything that you're exclusively good at – it could be something that you're curious about and haven't tried before. Everything counts! 
2. Lead an experiment: One of the best ways to come up with creative ideas is to lead an experiment. This means starting off by thinking about what you're not doing and trying something different instead.

The benefits of being creative:
According to a study done by the University of the Arts in Philadelphia, being creative has many benefits. Some of these benefits include: improved communication skills, better problem solving abilities, higher grades in school and increased self-esteem.
Being creative can help you communicate better. When you have an idea, you have to be able to explain it to others clearly so they can understand what you’re trying to say. This requires good communication skills.

Being creative can also help you solve problems better. If you can think outside the box, you’ll be able to come up with solutions that others might not think of. This is a valuable skill in any field.

Finally, being creative can lead to higher grades in school.
