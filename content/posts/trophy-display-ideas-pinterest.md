Conclusion: How does creativity work and how can we use it to our advantage?
Creativity is an important part of any business. By using creativity, businesses can come up with new ideas and solutions that may not have been thought of before. Additionally, creativity can help businesses reach new heights in their industry or achieve specific goals. Here are a few tips on how to use creativity to your advantage: 
1. Ideas are not came from a vacuum; they come from what you have in your periphery. When you start taking things apart and looking at them from other angles, you will get more creative ideas. This is especially true when it comes to brainstorming – by breaking things down into smaller pieces, you are more likely to come up with multiple different solutions that may be better for the company. 

2. Don’t be afraid to take risks; if something feels unorthodox or risky, it is likely because it is.

Overcoming barriers to innovation
Innovation is essential for businesses to maintain a competitive edge, but it can be difficult to encourage employees to think outside the box. Overcoming these barriers is key to promoting a culture of innovation in your organization.
One barrier to innovation is risk aversion. Employees may be hesitant to suggest new ideas for fear of being seen as failures if they don't work out. Encouraging a culture of experimentation can help overcome this hurdle by making it okay to try new things and fail.

Another common barrier is lack of resources. Employees may feel like they don't have the time or money to experiment with new ideas. Providing dedicated resources for innovation can help overcome this obstacle and show employees that you're serious about encouraging creativity.

Finally, some employees may simply be resistant to change. They may be comfortable with the way things are and see no need to innovate.
