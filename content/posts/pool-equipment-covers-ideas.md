This year, many articles and presentations were made about the future of technology. The topics ranged from the digital age to artificial intelligence and beyond. However, one thing that was conspicuously absent was any discussion on how technology could impact our social lives. 
It seems that many people are still quite unsure of how technology will have an impact on our daily lives. Some believe that it will only be a force for good, while others remain worried about its ability to divide us further along lines of gender, race, and economic status. Some may even see it as a harbinger of great evil - like in the case of AI becoming self-aware and exploiting humans for their own gain.

2022: What are the new ideas for businesses in 2022?
