Definition of creativity: How does it differ from mere creativity?
Creativity is an important word, but it can also be defined in different ways. In one definition, creativity is the ability to come up with new ideas or solutions for problems. This definition is a bit more broad, and does not include things like working on specific projects or creating something out of nothing. In another definition, creativity is the spark that ignites the creative process. This definition includes anything from creating new designs to coming up with new ways to market products. The key difference between these two definitions is how creativity is measured. One example could be when someone defines creativity as the ability to come up with new ideas or solutions for problems, but does not measure it against other criteria such as productivity or success. Another example could be measuring creativity by its ability to ignite the creative process.

The role of innovation in business:
Many businesses, including many small businesses, depend on innovation in order to remain competitive. Innovation can be defined as the application of new knowledge and ideas to solve a problem or increase efficiency in a business. Innovation is an essential part of business success, and small businesses especially need to be aware of how they can benefit from it.
There are several ways that small businesses can benefit from innovation, but the most important way is through increased efficiency. Efficiency is the ability of a business to produce goods and services efficiently using resources limited by cost or time. By increasing efficiency, small businesses can save money on their product or service offerings, which will then allow them to invest more in their other products and services. This increased investment will result in better customer service, higher profits, and more sustainable growth.

Increased innovation also leads to new product innovations.
