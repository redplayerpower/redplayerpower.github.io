What are the new ideas?
The new ideas in health care are based on the concept of patient-centricity, which is the idea that patients should always be the focus of the healthcare system. This shift away from traditional hospital-based care to apatient-led model would result in a reduction in costs and better patient outcomes. Another proposal is to adopt more outpatient services, such as walk-ins and telehealth. Other new ideas include using AI to help doctors rule out potential treatments and using data analytics to diagnose and treat diseases.

Group brainstorming
Group brainstorming can be a powerful tool for coming up with invention ideas. By pooling the creative resources of a group of people, you can come up with ideas that you might never have thought of on your own.
To get the most out of group brainstorming, it's important to create an environment where everyone feels comfortable sharing their ideas. This means establishing ground rules that allow for open and honest discussion without judgement. Once you've established this safe space, encourage everyone to share their ideas freely. The more diverse the perspectives in the group, the better!

With a little creativity and some outside-the-box thinking, group brainstorming can be a great way to generate new invention ideas.

What is innovation?
Innovation is the process of creating a new product or service that is different from the ones currently in use. Innovation can be seen in everything from medical treatments to fashion trends.
There are a few things to keep in mind when it comes to innovation. The first is that innovation should be incremental, meaning that it shouldn't come from one big leap forward but rather incremental changes that improve upon the current system. Second, innovation should be based on customer feedback and not just on what someone thinks is best for their business.
