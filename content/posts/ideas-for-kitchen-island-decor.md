Definition of innovation: What is it, and how does it differ from other types of innovation?
Innovation is the process of creating new and unique products or services that solve a problem. It can be defined in many ways, but one common definition is that innovation is the creation of a new way of doing something. Innovation can come from anywhere in the company, including the idea behind the product or service, as well as from within team members themselves. In order to be effective, innovation must be mutual and collaborative; it should not just rely on one person’s ideas or insights. 
One key difference between innovation and other forms of innovation is its focus on solving problems. Other types of innovation often seek to create new products or services that appeal to consumers (instead of solving problems), which can lead to less innovation overall. Innovation is instead focused on helping companies achieve their goals by improving their products or services.

How do we create new ideas?
Innovation is the process of creating new ideas. It can be found in everything from technology to business to creativity. Here are four ways to create new ideas:

1. Brainstorm with others: Brainstorming is a great way to get feedback and share your ideas with other people. You can also ask them for their opinion on a particular idea or topic.
2. Take on a challenge: Taking on a challenge is another way to create new ideas. Often, when you put yourself in an uncomfortable position, you’ll come up with better ideas than if you hadn’t taken the challenge.
3. Go beyond what people think is possible: Sometimes all it takes is going beyond what others think is possible to come up with better ideas.
