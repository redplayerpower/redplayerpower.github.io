The definition of art: What are the key factors that influence its definition?
Creative art is a type of art that is created by humans and often reflects their personal interpretation or feelings. It can be considered to be any form of art that is not just instantly reproducible andmissible, but requires time and effort to produce. The definition of creative art can vary depending on the person, but typically it includes:
1. A deep connection to the individual audience or subject matter.
2. An ability to evoke strong emotions in the viewer or listener.
3. Uniquely configured elements or techniques that create an original experience.
4. A style that is not easily reproduced or adapted without significant additional work or creativity required from the artist.

What are the benefits of having big ideas?
Big ideas can have a number of benefits, including making you more creative, sparkling your thinking, and sparking new insights. Here are five reasons why having big ideas is important: 
1. You’ll be more creative: The more you think out loud, the easier it is for your brain to come up with new ideas. When you have big ideas in your head, you’re less likely to be stuck on something and more likely to come up with a solution that meets both your needs and the task at hand. 
2. You’ll be sparkier: If you can see what other people could do better than you, it will make it easier for you to come up with new solutions.
