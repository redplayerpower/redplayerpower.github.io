Patent applications: How do you apply for a patent?
When you come up with an invention, the easiest way to protect it is to apply for a patent. Patent applications are filed with the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). In order to be considered for a patent, your invention must meet certain requirements, including: 
-Your invention must be new and not using copyrighted material
-Your invention must be on a subject that is currently being used in commerce or in the development of a product
-Your invention must have a clear and novel idea that can be patented
-Your Invention should be based on an existing product or service There are several ways to file for a patent, but many people start by submitting their idea to a competition or through their professional Labs. The USPTO has many resources available online so you can get started.

Types of innovation
Innovation comes in many different forms, and it is one of the most important aspects of any business. There are three main types of innovation: product, process, and business model.
Product innovation is all about creating new products or improving existing ones. This can be anything from coming up with a new invention to making small changes to an existing product. Process innovation is all about improving the way that products are made, such as introducing new methods or technologies. Business model innovation is all about changing the way that businesses operate, such as introducing new business models or ways of selling products.

Each type of innovation has its own benefits and challenges. Product innovation can lead to new revenue streams, but it can also be risky and expensive. Process innovation can improve efficiency and quality, but it can also be disruptive to existing operations.
