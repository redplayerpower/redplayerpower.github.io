Planning: How do you plan out your creative ideas?
Creative ideas are an important part of any creative plan, but it can be hard to come up with them. 
There are a few things you can do to help get started:

1. Come up with a rough idea of what you want to create. This will help you focus on the most important aspects of your project and make sure your ideas are well-explored. 
2. Look at other creative projects and see how they’ve planned out their ideas. This will give you some ideas for how you could approach your own project. 
3. Create a list of possible ideas and research which ones are best suited for your project. This will help ensure that your ideas are well thought-out and have potential for success.

There are many ways to brainstorm, but the process is always the same: you generate ideas by thinking creatively about a problem or issue. To brainstorm effectively, you need to set aside your judgment and allow yourself to come up with as many ideas as possible. Once you have a long list of ideas, you can start to narrow it down and choose the best ones. Brainstorming is a great way to come up with new ideas, solve problems, and get creative.
