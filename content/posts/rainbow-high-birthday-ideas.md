Effective ways to use creativity in your work.
Creativity is a necessary part of any work. It can be used to come up with new ideas, or to improve on current ones. Here are some tips on how to use creativity in your work: 
1. Take advantage of natural prompts: When you’re feeling creative, take advantage of whatever natural prompts come into your mind.
