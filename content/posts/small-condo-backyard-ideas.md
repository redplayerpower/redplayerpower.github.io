The evaluation of ideas
Evaluating ideas is important in order to determine which are worth pursuing and which are not. There are a few key factors to consider when evaluating an idea:
- How original is the idea? If it's been done before, is it being done in a new or different way?
- Is the idea feasible? Can it be realistically implemented?
- What is the potential impact of the idea? Will it make a difference?
- How much support does the idea have? Are there people who believe in it and will help to make it happen?
