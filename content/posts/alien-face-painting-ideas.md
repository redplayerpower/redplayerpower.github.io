How do you come up with new ideas?
As a creative thinker, you face many challenges when coming up with new ideas. One challenge is that it can be difficult to remember just what worked the last time you came up with an idea. Additionally, it can be difficult to come up with novel approaches to problem solving.  So how do you come up with new ideas? 
One approach is to brainstorm. By brainstorming, you can get rid of any old ideas and start from scratch. Additionally, by using headphones or other distractions, you can create an environment in which you are unable to think of any other ideas. Finally, if you have a specific idea in mind but are not sure how to bring it to life, then you can try outframing or milking an existing idea for new potential insights.

What is innovation and how does it differ from other forms of creativity?
Innovation is a term that has been used for different things in different times. It can be considered to be two different concepts, although they have many similarities. Innovation can be defined as the process of coming up with a new solution to a problem. This solution can be something that was previously thought impossible or something that was not even considered possible before. Innovation is also often described as being different from other forms of creativity, which is what this article will focus on. Other forms of creativity may involve coming up with ideas or solutions that are not practical or feasible.
