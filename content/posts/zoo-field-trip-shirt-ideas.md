Social Media and Digital divide: How will the digital divide affect society?
The digital divide is a problem that many people are beginning to worry about. It's when there is a huge difference in how people use the internet and how it affects society as a whole.

In this way, social media and digital divide have a lot of impact on our society. The future of our democracy may be at stake.

Future of Technology: What will the next big thing be?
As technology advances, there are always new and exciting possibilities for it to be used in different ways. One of the most likely examples of this is the use of artificial intelligence (AI). AI has already been used in many different ways, such as helping people with their day-to-day tasks, but it is only in the future that it will be used to create truly intelligent machines. This would mean that we could see machines that can think and process vast amounts of data on their own, making them stronger and smarter than ever before. Some believe that AI will even lead to a future where we don't need humans at all – we could have automated civilizations running our lives on autopilot. If this happens, we would have to rethink a lot of things about what it means to live in a world where technology is the protagonist.

The role of creativity in work: How does creativity impact productivity?
Creativity is a key factor in work. By definition, creativity is the ability to come up with new ideas and innovations. This can be seen in everything from creative writing to product development. In today's economy, creativity is becoming more and more important as businesses strive to stay competitive.
One way that creativity can help businesses is by providingid→products or services that are not possible with traditional methods. For example, an idea for a new product could come from a brainstorming session where everyone comes up with different concepts. Once the product is developed, it could be marketed using creative ideas like creating slogans or marketing videos that are unique and engaging.

Beyond just products and services, creativity also plays an important role in team productivity. When people have access to fresh and innovative ideas, they are able to come up with better solutions faster.
