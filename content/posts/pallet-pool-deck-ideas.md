What will be the impact of artificial intelligence and machine learning on society?
As the world moves closer to artificial intelligence and machine learning becoming more commonplace, society will face various changes. One of the most significant changes will be how work and life is organized. currently, many people are employed through their companies or by working off of a job contract. With the rise of AI and machine learning, this system could change completely. Instead of having someone employed by their company for a certain amount of time, people may instead be hired as “artificial intelligence assistants” or “machine learning experts”. This would change the way we interact with our machines, as well as how work is done. Additionally, businesses will have to adjust their business models in order to keep up with this new technology.
