Air Quality Issues in Your Home: Some tips for improving air quality in your home.
If you're like most people, you probably take air quality seriously when it comes to your home. You might think about greening your home, getting a air purifier, or even simply getting a better air quality index rating. However, there are other ways to improve air quality in your home as well – some of which are easy and can be done without too much effort. Here are a few tips for improving air quality in your home: 
1) Make sure your windows are properly sealed. Poorly sealed windows allow harmful particles from the outside into the house and can cause respiratory problems.

2) Get a good air purifier. Air purifiers can help clean the air around you and reduce the amount of unhealthy ozone gas that is created by car engines and other sources.

3) Use proper ventilation!

The power of suggestion: How can creativity be used to create ideas?
Creativity is often thought of as a natural ability. But it can also be used to create new ideas. In fact, suggestion can be one of the most powerful tools that you have. By suggesting an idea to someone, you can increase the chance of them actually following through with it. Here are three ways that suggestion can help you get your creative juices flowing: 
1. Suggest a task that someone may not have considered before: Often times, when we think about creativity, we think about things that are immediately obvious or something that we ourselves could do. However, many times what we see in front of us is simply too daunting or complex for us to tackle on our own.suggesting a task that someone may not have considered before can help open up their minds and allow them to become inspired by something new and unfamiliar.

How to Organize Your Home: There are many ways to organize your home, and each one has its own advantages and disadvantages. Make sure you choose the method that is best for you.
diy ideas for organizing your home are endless, but some simple tips can make a big difference. Here are a few ideas to get you started:
1. Create separate areas for storage and use as your personal office or bedroom area. This will help you to focus on work in peace and avoid cluttering up your home with unnecessary objects.

2. Try using bins or organizers to keep important items more easily accessible. This can help you to quickly grab something if it's needed and keep track of what's where in case you lose it.

3. Get organized by creating a pegboard system according to the type of furniture in your home. For example, if you have an Ikea kitchen table, put all the cooking pots and pans on one pegboard and all the cups, spoons, measuring cups etc., on another pegboard.
