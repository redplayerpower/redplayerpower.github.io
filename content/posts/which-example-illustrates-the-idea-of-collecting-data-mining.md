The definition of an invention: What is it?
Inventions are creations that make things work better or easier than they would without them. They can be physical objects like a car or a computer, or intellectual property like a patent or trade secret. There are many different types of inventions, and the definition of an invention can vary depending on what you're looking for. For example, some people might define an invention as a new product, while others might focus on making something easier or more efficient. This concept is also important to understand when it comes to patenting an invention - not all inventions need to be patented in order for them to be considered an invention.
