Ideas that work: What makes a good idea successful?
Ideas that work have a clear path to fruition and are able to be scaled up or down as needed. They also have a sense of humor, which can make them relatable and fun to follow. Here are six ideas that have been successful in the past:

2. Develop an app – App development is another popular idea that has been successful in the past. An app allows users to do something specific, such as ordering food or shopping for products online, without having to visit multiple websites or go through customer service.
