Opportunity/Opportunity: How will this opportunity be realized?
Big Ideas are what will drive the innovation and success of any given opportunity. This opportunity is no different. With the right ideas, anyone can see potential in this business model and bring it to life. Here are a few ideas to get you started: 
1. Create a unique selling proposition (USP) that sets your business apart from your competitors. This can be done through market research or by creating a compelling story about how you're different than your peers. 
2. Develop a product or service that solves an existing problem or fills an important need. This can come in the form of a new way of doing things, an innovative solution, or a unique product or service that's not available on the market yet. 
3. Use marketing channels such as online ads, social media, and paid search to reach potential customers and generate leads and sales opportunities.
