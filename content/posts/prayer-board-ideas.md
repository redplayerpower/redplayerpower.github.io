How innovation happens
Innovation is not a one time event or process. It is an ongoing, continuous journey that starts with a thought and ends with a new product or service. Innovation is about taking risks and looking for potential solutions to problems. Innovation can be found in everything from the smallest details of how we interact with the world to the largest ideas in business.
