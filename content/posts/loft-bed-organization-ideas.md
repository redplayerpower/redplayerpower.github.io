Invention ideas come in all shapes and sizes, but the key to a good one is creativity. With new technology constantly evolving, it can be hard to identify what makes an invention successful. But here are four tips for finding the right innovation:

2. Don’t be afraid to take risks. After all, if it’s risk-free, then who is going to pay for it? If you have a good idea and can get people to invest in it, go for it!
3. Be nimble and fast-paced.
