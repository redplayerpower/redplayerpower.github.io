Brainstroming is a new way of thinking that promises to change the way we think about intelligence and creativity. It is a form of mental gymnastics that uses brain waves to improve problem-solving skills. The theory behind brainstroming is that by focusing on certain patterns and ideas, we can improve our thinking skills and increase our creativity.
There are already several companies that use brainstroming in their businesses.

Other companies that are using brainstroming include Google, Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft.
