What can we do to prepare for 2020?
It has been announced that the United States will be leaving the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2020. This decision is a result of the US president, Donald Trump, wanting to reduce trade deficits and increase economic growth. The main challenge for many countries planning for 2020 is how to prepare for this event. Here are some ideas to help: 
1. Make sure you have an idea of what your country’s trade deficit is. This information can be found on various websites or by talking to your business or government officials. 
2. Get involved in tariff debates with other countries. This can help you develop agreements that will protect your industry from new tariffs being placed by other countries. 
3. Do research on future trends in trade. By doing this, you will be able to identify any potential problems that may arise during the 2020 WTO membership negotiations.

The history of creative art: How did creativity dawn and what has been its most successful application?
Creativity has been around since ancient times and is one of the most popular applications of creativity in today’s world. One of its earliest incarnations was art, which began to be developed as a way to communicate with others. Art was used to depict beautiful things and express feelings, which is why it has been such an important part of human culture. From there, creative art started to be used in more practical ways, such as for making things that people could use or sell. It even went on to be adopted by businesses and other institutions, helping them produce more efficient products. With so many different applications for creativity, it is hard to say which one has been the most successful in terms of revenue and impact.
