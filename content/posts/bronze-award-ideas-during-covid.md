Implementation: How do you go about using new ideas to improve your business or organization?
When it comes to implementing new ideas, creativity is key. This is why businesses and organizations should take the time to brainstorm what they would like to accomplish with their new initiatives. After all, if a business does not have any clear goals or objectives, it will be difficult to put together a successful plan of action.
One way to come up with specific goals and objectives for your new initiative is by using a brainstorming tool. The most popular option for this is called Scrum, which stands for “Scenario Planning and Reworking in Construction”. This tool allows businesses and organizations to come up with specific goals that need to be accomplished in order for them to meet a certain deadline.

Another great way to come up with specific goals is by using SWOT analysis.

Idea #3:
Ideas are the bedrock of any successful enterprise. Whether you're starting a business, developing a new product, or simply trying to solve a problem, having a great idea is the first step.
But what makes a great idea? And how can you come up with one? Here are three key tips:

1. Look for problems to solve. A great idea usually comes from solving a problem. So if you're looking for an idea, start by identifying problems that need solving. This could be something as simple as making your daily commute more efficient, or it could be something more complex like developing a new treatment for cancer.

2. Brainstorm with others. Sometimes the best ideas come from collaboration. If you're stuck, try brainstorming with friends, family, or colleagues.
