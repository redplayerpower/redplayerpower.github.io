Types of creativity: Intuitive, analytical, creative, practical.
Creativity is a natural ability that everyone has. Whether you're an artist, musician, writer, or scientist, creativity is an essential part of who you are. However, there are different types of creativity that can be more effective in different areas of life. Intuitive creativity is the creative process that comes from feeling something without knowing what it is. Analystically creative people use their intellect to come up with solutions to problems. Practical creativity is the ability to use what you know to achieve results. When it comes to creativity, there are many different options available and each one is effective in a different way.

Conclusion: Summarize the main points of the article.
Invention is the process of creating something new. It can be a new product, a new way of doing something, or a new process. Inventors are people who come up with new ideas and find ways to make them work.
The invention process generally includes four steps: coming up with the idea, developing the idea, testing the idea, and commercializing the idea. Inventors typically use their creativity and knowledge to come up with an initial idea. They then develop that idea by doing research, making prototypes, and testing their invention. Once they have a working prototype, they commercialize their invention by marketing it and selling it to consumers.

Inventions can be big or small. They can be life-changing or just make someone's life a little easier. But all inventions start with an idea.

Conclusion: What are some things to keep in mind when thinking about big ideas?
Big ideas are something that can change the world. They are thinkpieces that have the potential to change how we live, work, and think about the world. There are a few things to keep in mind when thinking about big ideas. 
1. Make sure your idea is worth pursuing. If your idea isn’t worth pursuing, it won’t get implemented or scaled up. 
2. Be realistic about what you can do and what you can’t do. If you don’t have the resources or experience to make your idea a reality, be realistic about how much effort and time it will require to bring it to market. 
3. Don’t over-estimate your skillset or abilities.

The relationship between creativity and success: What are the implications for us?
Creativity and success are often said to go together like a fine wine and cheese. But what does that actually mean for artists? What are the implications for us? And how do we create the creative work that leads to success?
The answer to all of these questions is that there is no one-size-fits-all answer, but the key is to combine creativity with discipline, practice, and hard work. In order to be successful as an artist, you need to have a strong mix of both talent and effort.

But what does this mean for us as artists? It means that if you want to be successful as an artist, you need to find ways to combine your creativity with your discipline. This can involve finding new ways to approach your work, learning new techniques, and practicing at least twice a day – no matter what your current level of creativity is.
