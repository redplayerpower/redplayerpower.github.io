How will new technologies affect our lives?
New technologies are constantly changing and advancing, making it difficult to predict how they will affect our lives. Some potential changes include: 
1) Increased use of AI – This technology is already changing the way we live, with companies like Amazon looking to use AI in everything from customer service to parcel delivery. 
2) Low-cost 4G phones – It’s not hard to imagine a future where everyone has a low-cost 4G phone that they can use anywhere. This could have a significant impact on how we live and work, as well as what kind of services we can access. 
3)Augmented Reality (AR): In 2020, AR will become more prevalent than ever before, with devices like Google Daydream View and Apple’s A12 Bionic Chipset capable of rendering 3D content in real time.
