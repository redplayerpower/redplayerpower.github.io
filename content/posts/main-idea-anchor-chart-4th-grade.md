Big Ideas are a type of brainstorming tool that can help you come up with new solutions to problems. Big Ideas can be helpful when you have no idea what to do next, or when you need to come up with a plan that will work. Don't be afraid to ask your friends and family for their ideas, either- they may have something that you hadn't considered.

Why is innovation important?
Innovation is important because it drives economic growth. Innovation can be found in everything from the smallest details of a product to the most complex algorithms. It enables businesses to create new products and services that meet customer needs, and it also allows them to stay ahead of their competition.
But innovation isn't just about making new products or services; it's also about creating new ways for businesses to do their work. This may seem like a relatively small detail, but it could provide the company with an edge over its competitors. For example, imagine a business that is able to create custom-made shoes Made in America. That company would be much more likely to be successful than one that relies on global production methods.

Innovation is also important because it helps companies keep up with changing technology.

Ideas are the lifeblood of any startup. Without them, startups would quickly become lost in their own heads and would be unable to solve pressing problems. This is why it's so important for startups to have a strong ideatrack. With a strong idea track, startups can focus on creating the best ideas possible, not on developing products or services that may or may not be successful.
