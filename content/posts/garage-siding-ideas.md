4. How do you manage conflict within your organization? Who has final say on important decisions, and who can appeal if they feel their opinion is not being heard or respected?
5. Are there any Committee or Board members that are not elected by the membership, but rather appointed by someone outside of the organization (e.g., CEO)? If so, how does this affect the ability for members to voice their opinions effectively within the organization?
