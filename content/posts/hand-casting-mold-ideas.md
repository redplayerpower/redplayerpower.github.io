Idea 3: What are some creative ways you can use technology in your work?
Creative ways to use technology in your work is a topic that is constantly on the rise in the workplace. With new technologies being developed constantly, there are endless possibilities for creative ways to use them in your work. Here are three ideas to get started: 
1. Use technology to help you plan and organize your work. By using a computer program or website, you can create planner pages that show you what tasks need to be done next and where they fit into the overall project schedule. This can help you avoid overlap and make sure each task is completed as planned. 
2. Use technology to keep communication open between team members. Using chat applications or virtual reality headsets, you can easily share photos, updates, and ideas with other team members without having to leave your work space.
