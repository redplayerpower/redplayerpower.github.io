Creative art is a process of creating something new, whether it is a painting, sculpture, musical composition, or anything else that can be considered art. The process often involves coming up with an idea, and then using one's imagination to bring that idea to life. It can be a solo activity or done with others. There are no rules, and the only limit is one's own imagination.
