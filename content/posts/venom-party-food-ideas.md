The Invention Process: Describe the steps involved in coming up with an invention idea.
Inventing something new can be a daunting task, but it doesn't have to be. By following a few simple steps, you can turn your idea into a reality.
The first step is to come up with an idea. This can be anything that you think would make life easier or more fun. Once you have an idea, the next step is to do some research. See if anyone has already invented what you're thinking of, and if so, how you can improve upon it.

Once you're satisfied with your prototype, the final step is to patent your invention and start mass-producing it for the world to enjoy!

The creative process
When it comes to the creative process, there are a few key things to keep in mind. First and foremost, it’s important to be open-minded and willing to experiment. Secondly, don’t be afraid to take risks – creativity often comes from stepping outside of your comfort zone. And finally, trust your instincts; if something feels right, go with it.
