Definition of creativity: What makes something creative?
Creativity is the ability of an individual to think outside the box and come up with new ideas or solutions to problems. It can be found in any form, from creative writing to architectural design. To many, creativity is seen as a verb, meaning that someone does something creative in order to produce something new. However, for some, creativity stems from the act of thinking, rather than doing. This definition of creativity is flexible and can be used for any type of artistic work.

Causes and Effects of Innovation: Why do people innovate?
Innovation is a natural process that is necessary for businesses to succeed. It allows companies to come up with new ideas and products that can compete in the market. Innovation also benefits society as a whole by creating new technologies and innovations that make life easier for people. There are many reasons why innovation happens, but one of the most important reasons is for the business benefit. In order for a company to be successful, it needs to have innovative products and services that can appeal to customers. However, there are also negative effects of innovation that can impact businesses and society as a whole. There are several reasons why this might happen, but one of the most common is when businesses try to change the status quo by introducing new products or services that are not popular yet. In doing so, they risk disrupting the established order in their industry or putting their competitors at a disadvantage.

creativity: How do you improve your invention ideas?
Creativity is essential to any invention. Every step of the process from Ideation to Execution should be tailored to increase creativity and improve the chances of a successful product. Here are four tips for improving your invention ideas:
1. Be persistent
Inevitably, every invention will not be perfect. That’s okay! The important thing is that you keep trying and learning until you find something that works well and can be improved upon. Keep a notebook or digital sketchbook where you can jot down ideas as they come to you, so you have access to them when needed. This way, you won’t get lost in your work and can focus on what really matters- developing a great product.

2. Be open to feedback
Feedback is key in ANY creative process.
