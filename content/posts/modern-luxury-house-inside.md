What are the different types of ideas?
Ideas are everywhere. Whether it’s on a T-shirt, in your head, or on the internet, there are always new and innovative ways to approach problems and solve problems. 
There are many types of ideas, but here are three that stand out the most to me: 
1. The brainstorming method: This is a great way to come up with new ideas for products or services. Simply take some time and brainstorm all of the different options until you have a few that you like the best.
2. The problem/solution process: This is another great way to come up with new ideas for products or services. Once you have a few good ones, you can start working on solving the real world problems that they address.
