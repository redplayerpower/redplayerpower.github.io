What are some 2020 ideas?
2020 is a year of opportunity. It's a time to think about what we can do to make our world a better place. Here are two ideas that could help: 
The first is the United Nations' " Agenda 21 ," which calls for creating an international body to focus on sustainable development. This would be a great way to bring together different groups of people who have something to say about how the world should be run, and it would also be a good way to learn from other countries. 
The second is the Global Compact on climate change, which was started in 2014 by more than 190 countries. The idea behind it is that all countries must take steps to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, or less. This would mean reducing emissions from industries and buildings, improving energy efficiency, and investing in renewable energy sources.

Overcoming the challenges of bringing a big idea to life
There are many challenges that come with bringing a big idea to life. The first challenge is often just getting started. It can be difficult to take that first step, but it's important to remember that every journey begins with a single step. Once you've taken that first step, the next challenge is often keeping your motivation high. It's easy to get discouraged when you encounter setbacks, but it's important to keep your eye on the prize and remember why you're doing this in the first place. Finally, another common challenge is maintaining momentum. It can be difficult to keep moving forward when you're feeling bogged down or burned out, but it's important to push through and keep your energy up. These are just some of the challenges you may face when bringing a big idea to life, but if you stay focused and committed, you can overcome them and achieve your goals.
