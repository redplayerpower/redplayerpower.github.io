The three types of big ideas: A crazy idea, a good idea, and a bad idea
There are three types of big ideas: crazy, good, and bad. Crazy ideas are always exciting, and can help to change the course of history. Good ideas have the potential to make a big impact on people and the world. However, there is always risk associated with them- some might be great, while others might not be so great after all. But when it comes time to make a decision, it’s important to weigh the risks and benefits of each idea before coming up with a decision.
Bad Ideas are simply terrible, and often have no chance of becoming anything other than infamous failures. They may seem like something that could never work or might even lead to disaster- but in reality, they often do just that. It’s important to be vigilant when assessing any new idea- especially those with such potential for disaster.

The five types of brainstorming: open, collaborative, focused, problem-solving, and creative.
Brainstorming is one of the most essential skills for any business or professional. It can be used for creative problem solving, brainstorming for ideas for products and services, and more. However, not all brainstorming sessions are created equal. Here are five different types of brainstorming that can help improve your session productivity: 
1. Open brainstorming: This type of brainstorming is usually used when there is no specific goal to achieve or when everyone is free to come and go as they please. In this type of session, everyone is given a set amount of time to come up with ideas and then those ideas are prioritized based on how important they think they are.

2. Collaborative brainstorming: This type of brainstorming helps teams work together towards a common goal.

Conclusion
In the past few years, the idea of a virtual reality headset has become more and more popular. Some people use it for gaming, others use it to watch movies or TV shows, but most people are just getting started with this technology. 
One of the newest features of virtual reality headsets is that they can be used to create 3D experiences. This is where you take your normal physical world and make it look like it's in a different place or dimension. It's a great way to explore new worlds without having to leave your home. 

There are some ways that virtual reality headsets can be used for education as well. For example, you could use them in class to help students learn about different cultures or worlds. You could also use them to help teach kids about life in other countries or worlds.
