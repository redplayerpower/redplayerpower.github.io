Idea 3: We need to be more open about our values
The world is constantly changing, and so too are the ways that people value and hold onto certain values. In order to stay ahead of the curve, we need to be more open about our own values.
One way to do this is by sharing our thoughts with others. Another way is by writing down what we believe and why it matters to us. Sometimes, all it takes is a conversation with someone who understands our values in order for us to start writing them down ourselves.

Ultimately, we need to be more conscious about how we value the things that matter most to us in order to stay ahead of the curve and stay true to our own values.
