What are some invention ideas?
1. Invention ideas are always in flux, and since new technologies keep popping up, it’s hard to come up with anything that’s truly original. However, there are a few things that you can try and base your inventions off of. One idea is to take an old technology and make it more user-friendly. Another idea is to come up with a new way of doing something that has been done before but not in the same way.

How does brainstroming work?
There is much debate surrounding the impact of brainstroming on cognitive functions, but there is little known about how it works. A recent study by scientists at the University of Utah found that when subjects are exposed to a burst of stimulation their brains release neurochemical substances that improve their cognitive performance. The study also showed that the release of these neurochemical substances was associated with increased activity in areas of the brain responsible for memory and attention.
