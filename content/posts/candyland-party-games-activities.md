If you're looking for invention ideas, start by taking a look at the things around you that could be improved. What annoys you on a daily basis? What would make your life easier? Chances are, there are others out there who feel the same way and would love to use your invention.

Another great place to find invention ideas is by talking to people. Ask them about the problems they face on a daily basis. What do they wish they had that would make their lives easier? You may be surprised at how many people have great ideas for inventions but never act on them.
