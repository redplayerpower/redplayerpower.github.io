Types of creativity: Intuition, inspiration, and reason.
Creativity is a spectrum. From the simple to the complex, there are many different ways that creativity can be expressed. Intuition, inspiration, and reason are three of the most common ways that creativity can be expressed. Intuition is when you don’t have any specific information about how something should look or feel, and inspiration comes from your own ideas or memories. Reason comes from knowing why something exists and what it has done for other people or things in the past. These three forms of creativity can all be used interchangeably, but they each have their own strengths and weaknesses. Intuition is often used to create new ideas, while inspiration helps you see what has already been done and why it was successful. Reason is often used to find solutions to problems, while intuition can be used for more creative thinking outside of the box.
