Invention has always been a major part of human history. From the invention of fire to the development of cars, people have used their ingenuity to make new products and technologies. However, innovation has changed over time, as it has become more and more difficult to come up with new ideas. This is due to a variety of reasons, some of which are global in scope and others specific to each country or industry.
One example of how innovation has changed over time is in the field of telecommunications. With the advent of technology such as radio and television, people were able to communicate with one another far easier than they had ever before.
