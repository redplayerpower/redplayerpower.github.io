How Innovation Can Benefit Your Business: from Cut Costs to Higher Productivity

Second, some innovations may not be appropriate for every business - if they're not well-suited to your company's culture or mission, you may find that they don't work as well in the long run.

Evaluation methods
Evaluating ideas for inventions can be difficult. There are many factors to consider when trying to decide if an invention is worth pursuing. The first step is to come up with a list of criteria that the invention must meet. Once you have a list of criteria, you can start evaluating ideas against those criteria.
Some factors to consider when evaluating invention ideas include: market potential, patentability, manufacturing feasibility, and profitability. Other important considerations include: how unique the idea is, how much it will cost to develop and produce the invention, and whether there is a demand for the invention.

The best way to evaluate an invention idea is to consult with experts in the field. These experts can help you determine if an idea has potential and is worth pursuing. They can also provide guidance on how to develop and commercialize the invention.
