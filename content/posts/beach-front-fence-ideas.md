How to come up with big ideas
If you're looking for big ideas, the best way to come up with them is by brainstorming. It's an effective way to get your creative juices flowing and come up with new ways to think about problems or possibilities. If you're not sure how to do this, here are some tips:
1. Start by thinking about what you know. What are some of the things that have bedeviled you in the past? What have been some of your biggest challenges? Once you've gathered these information, it's time to start brainstorming potential solutions.

2. Be open-minded. Don't be afraid to change your mind if something comes up during your brainstorming session. After all, creativity is a risky business - it might be fun or it might not work - so don't be afraid to experiment!
