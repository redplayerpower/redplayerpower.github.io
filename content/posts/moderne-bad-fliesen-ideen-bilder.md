The future of finance: What will new financial technologies mean for society?
There are a number of new financial technologies that could have a dramatic impact on society in the next few years. Here are four examples:
1. Blockchains: Blockchain technology is a distributed database that allows for secure, transparent and tamper-proof transactions. This could mean big changes for the way money is used, especially in the banking and insurance sectors.

2. Artificial intelligence (AI): AI has already been used to identify and predict stock prices, make financial decisions and even provide human advisors to businesses. It's only going to get more advanced and sophisticated in the future, and with the right applications – such as peer-to-peer marketplaces or taxes – it could also have a huge impact on social issues such as joblessness and poverty.

The importance of creativity: What are we trying to accomplish with creativity?
Creativity is important in many ways. It allows people to come up with new ideas and solutions that may not have been thought of before. Additionally, creativity can be used to improve personal relationships and businesses. However, without proper creativity, some things may not go as planned. For example, if a business does not have fresh and innovative ideas, their customers may be less likely to return or recommend them to others.
