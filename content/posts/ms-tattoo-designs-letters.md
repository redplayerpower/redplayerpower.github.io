The challenge of innovation: What are the challenges associated with innovative thinking?
Invention ideas are at the heart of most businesses and economies. They can provide new products or services that improve how people live, work, and play. But innovation can be a challenge, as it often requires fresh thinking and new ways of looking at old ideas. Here are some challenges associated with innovative thinking:
1) Finding the right balance – trying too hard to be different can backfire, leading to stagnation or even failure.

2) Facing the unknown – trying to invent something that has never been done before can be risky and time-consuming.

3) Working with others – collaborating with other teams and individuals can help speed up the process and create a more cohesive group.

4) Creating value – creating new products or services that offer value for customers is one of the most difficult aspects of innovation.

Different brainstorming techniques
When it comes to brainstorming, there is no one-size-fits-all approach. The best way to brainstorm depends on the situation and the type of project you’re working on. Here are three different brainstorming techniques to try:
1. Brainwriting

Brainwriting is a great option when you need to generate a lot of ideas quickly. To brainwrite, each person in the group writes down their ideas on a piece of paper. Then, everyone passes their paper to the person next to them, who adds their own ideas. This continues until everyone has had a chance to add to all of the ideas.

2. Round Robin

The round robin technique is similar to brainwriting, but with one key difference: instead of passing around a piece of paper, each person takes turns verbally sharing their ideas with the group.
