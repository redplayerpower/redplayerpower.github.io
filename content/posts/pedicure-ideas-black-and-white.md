what brainstorming is, how to do it
Brainstorming is a technique used to generate ideas for a project or problem. To brainstorm, you simply need to allow your mind to wander and come up with as many ideas as possible. There are no wrong answers in brainstorming, so don't worry about being too creative. Just let your thoughts flow and see where they take you.
To get started, find a quiet place where you can relax and focus on the task at hand. Then, set a timer for 10-15 minutes and start writing down whatever comes to mind. Don't worry about editing or critiquing your ideas at this stage; just let them flow freely. Once the timer goes off, you can start looking through your list of ideas and identifying which ones are the most promising.

The Impacts of Invention: How does innovation impact society as a whole?
Inventions have been a part of society for centuries, but the impact of innovation has only grown in recent decades. Innovation has the ability to change the way we live and work, as well as the ways we view the world around us. The benefits of innovation are vast, and it has had a positive impact on economies, society, and environment. However, there are some challenges that need to be considered before continuing to see such positive impacts. One key challenge is that innovation can often lead to new technologies that can be dangerous or harmful if not used responsibly. Another challenge is that innovation often depends on someone else’s idea or idea being implemented first, which can lead to competition andefficiency in some industries. Overall, these challenges underscore the importance of ensuring that all who benefit from innovation are taken care of when it comes time for new products or services to be created.

Conclusion: Summarize the main points of the article.
A new invention is always something to be celebrated. It's a sign that progress is being made and that people are still coming up with new and innovative ideas. But what happens when an invention goes wrong? When it doesn't work as intended or, even worse, causes harm?
There have been plenty of examples throughout history of inventions that have had disastrous consequences. The atomic bomb is perhaps the most famous example. Invented during World War II, it was used twice in combat, resulting in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people.

Other examples include the Ford Pinto, which was prone to exploding if involved in a rear-end collision, and the Segway, which has been involved in numerous accidents and injuries.
