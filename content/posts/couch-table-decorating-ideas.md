How can people come up with big ideas that will help them achieve their goals?
People often come up with ideas for big goals in different ways – some through brainstorming, others through cold hard thinking. It can be difficult to know where to start when trying to come up with big ideas, but here are a few tips that could help:
1. Keep your big idea simple: When you have a bunch of ideas floating around your head, it can be hard to focus on just one. Break your goal down into smaller, more manageable chunks and work on one at a time. This will make it easier to see the connection between them and make sure you are actually on the same page as your team or clients.
