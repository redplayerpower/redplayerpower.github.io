Creative Ideas For You: What do you have in mind that you haven't thought of before?
Creative ideas can be anything you want them to be, but there are a few key things to keep in mind when coming up with creative ideas. First, think about what you want your idea to accomplish. Sometimes all it takes is a little creativity and inspiration to come up with something new and exciting. Second, make sure that your idea is feasible. If your idea doesn't have a lot of money or time put into it, it might not be worth your while to pursue it. Finally, make sure that your idea is funny or entertaining enough before you even think about pursuing it. These three points will help make any creative ideas more likely to become reality.

gap between theory and practice in innovation: Innovation always involves a change in perspective
The gap between theory and practice in innovation can often be a major obstacle to successful innovation. This problem is compounded by the fact that different fields of study have different methodologyologies and approaches to innovation. This lack of consistency is often the cause of failure when it comes to new product conception or business models. To break through this barrier, researchers typically adopt a methodological perspective, which takes into account the current state of knowledge in their field. In addition, practitioners need to adopt an innovative mindset, which means constantly seeking new ways to improve old products and services. The two sides of the innovation equation need to come together for a better understanding of how the product should be designed, what kind of customer service should be offered, and how much impact new ideas will have on older ones.
