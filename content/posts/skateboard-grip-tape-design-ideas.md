Conclusion: Some ways to overcome the challenges associated with implementing big ideas.
Introduction
Big ideas are always a challenge, but they can be overcome with the right planning and execution. Here are a few tips to help you get started:

1. Take the time to do your research: big ideas often come with a lot of unknowns and potential challenges. Start by doing some basic research on the topic before coming up with any ideas. This will help you understand what challenges you might face and how best to tackle them.

2. Be prepared to fight for your ideas: big ideas often require a lot of work and effort, even if it's just starting out. Don't be afraid to put in the extra elbow grease – it'll definitely pay off in the end!

3. Be persistent: once you've nailed down some key aspects of your idea, keep pushing until you're ready to submit it to anyone who will listen.

The Future of Housing: How will technology change housing and homelessness?
Technology is already changing many aspects of our everyday lives, from how we shop to how we cook. It could soon change the way we live and work too, with implications for housing and homelessness. This article will explore some of the possibilities. 
One idea is that technology could help to create more affordable housing by providing a more accurate representation of what people actually need and want in their homes. Another possibility is that it could help individuals or groups who are homeless or at risk of homelessness to find new homes, either through advertizing or directly working with landlords. 

All of these ideas are just starting to be considered, and there are still many questions remaining about how they will be implemented. However, if done correctly, these changes could have positive impacts on both individuals and groups who need housing but don't currently have it.
