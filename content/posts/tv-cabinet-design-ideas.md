How to get great ideas: Take time to think productively, don't rely on external sources, and be open to feedback.
If you're like most people, you go through the motions of thinking productively but don't really get out there and generate new ideas. You might rely on external sources to get your creative juices flowing, or you may be afraid to give feedback because it could mean you're not working in the right direction. If you take the time to think productively, though, all of those assumptions and inhibitions fall away. You can also be open to feedback – even if it's a little bit challenging – because it will help you become better at generating new ideas.

Invention history: What inspired various inventors to come up with new ideas?
Invention history is a fascinating topic to explore, as it offers insights into the creativity and motivation behind inventors. Some of the most famous and influential inventors in history include Leonardo da Vinci, Nikola Tesla, Charles Darwin, and Marie Curie. Each inventor had their own unique ideas that led to new technologies and products. In some cases, these ideas were simply firsts – for example, da Vinci’s drawing of a three-dimensional image in paper was the first use of a technical drawing instrument in history. However, other inventions may have had more significant impacts on society or the economy. For example, Darwin’s theory of evolution led to the development of mass produced products like cars and machines. This theory also helped to change how people view themselves and their environment – thanks in part to his invention of the scientific method.

The definition of creativity
What is creativity? Many people have different definitions for creativity. Some say that it is when you come up with new and original ideas, while others define it as the ability to think outside the box and come up with solutions to problems.
Creativity can be defined as the ability to generate new and innovative ideas. It is often seen as a process of problem solving, where you take existing knowledge and use it in new and unique ways. Creativity is often associated with artistry and design, but it can also be found in other areas such as business, science, and technology.

There are many ways to encourage creativity. One way is to provide opportunities for people to work on creative projects together. This can help them to come up with new ideas and solutions by bouncing ideas off of each other.

Invention Ideas: How can they be put into practice?
Invention ideas can be put into practice in a number of ways. Some are more complicated than others, but all of them have the potential to make a big impact. Here are five possible ways: 
1. Use technology to create new products or services. This could take the form of developing new artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, building virtual reality headsets or creating 3D printing coral reef models.
2. Use renewable energy sources to generate electricity from the sun or wind resources. This could involve developing solar panels, wind turbines or electric vehicles that run on diesel or gasoline instead of gasoline or oil. 
3. Use natural materials to make products or services more sustainable and environmentally friendly. These could include using bamboo for furniture, using recycled materials for insulation or recycling plastic bottles into water bottles and cups. 
4. Use recycled materials in new products or services.
