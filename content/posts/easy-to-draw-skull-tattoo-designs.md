what is creative art?
Creative art is a process of creating something new, whether it’s a painting, sculpture, dance, or story. It’s about using your imagination to create something that didn’t exist before. 
Creative art can be therapeutic and can help you express yourself in a way that you might not be able to with words. It can also be a form of relaxation and can help reduce stress. 

Whether you’re a professional artist or someone who just likes to doodle, creative art is for everyone. So get out your paints, pencils, or whatever else you like to use, and start creating!

Do you ever feel like your brain is just not working as well as it used to?

Regardless of why your brain feels sluggish, there are some simple steps you can take to help improve its performance. Here are four tips for improving brainstroming: 
1.Set a clear goal
Brainstroming is all about problem solving and coming up with a solution to a difficult question or issue.
