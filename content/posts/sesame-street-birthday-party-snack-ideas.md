Types of creativity: The five types
Creativity is everywhere, and it's often difficult to distinguishing between the different types of creativity. However, here are five of the most common types of creativity:
1. Visual: Seeing things in a different way or making them come alive.
2. Perceptive: Understanding and application of new knowledge in order to create something new or improve an existing product or service. 
3. Analytical: Identifying problems and solutions in complex situations and then coming up with creative solutions. 
4. Impulsive: Acting on instinctive feelings or impulses without thinking about it first.

The difference between creativity and art: What are the essential differences?
Creativity, or the ability to think outside the box, is one of the most essential traits for a successful artist. Because creativity is so important, it can be hard to determine which category a person falls into when it comes to art.Some people may see creativity as simply coming up with new ideas or concepts; while others could see creativity as the ability to express oneself in a unique way. It all boils down to what someone considers essential to their artistry.
There are two main categories of creatives- those who come up with ideas and those who create something beautiful. While both types of creatives require some great talent and dedication, there are key differences that set creatives apart from other artists. 

The first difference between creative art and everyday art is that creative art often has a specific purpose or goal in mind.

What is invention?
Invention is the creation of a new product or idea. It can be anything from an improvement on an existing product to a completely new design. Inventions can have a huge impact on society, and sometimes they are the stuff of legends.
Many inventions are based on ideas that were first floated around in Hungary during the 18th century. These include the Hungarian alphabet, which was created by Nicholas-Jacques Conte in 1795, and the gypsy ballpoint pen, which was developed by Ferenc Puskás in 1912. Other famous inventions include the Segway vehicle and the Heath Robinson helicopters.
