The challenges of coming up with big ideas
In any creative endeavor, there are always challenges to overcome. Whether it’s coming up with original ideas or finding your voice in a crowd of others, creativity is always a work in progress. And while some challenges can be easily resolved (such as coming up with a great slogan), others pose more difficult obstacles. Big Ideas are one such challenge, and while they can be easy to come by (just look at any popular blog or online article on the topic), they often require time and effort to put together into a successful product or business idea.
Despite the challenge, big ideas make for great products and businesses. They represent an innovative new way of thinking that can encourage change and spur innovation. And while big ideas can take time and effort to develop into something successful, they’re worth the investment.

How to Take the Place of a Boss and Make More Money
Do you feel like your job isn't providing the financial stability that it used to? Are you sick of feeling like you're in control and always having to fight for your food, clothes, and housing? If so, there are a few new ideas out there that could help you take the place of a boss and make more money. Here are three:
1. Start your own business: many people feel like they have no choice but to work for somebody else because their income doesn't meet their needs. But if you start your own businesses, you can control your own income and set your own hours. This is an excellent way to make more money because it means you can set your own goals instead of working towards somebody else's.

2. become a freelancer: freelancing is the process of doing freelance jobs without getting paid for them.

What is innovation and how does it differ from other types of creativity?
Innovation is a process of creating new ideas or products that solve a problem. It can come in many forms- from the invention of the telephone to the development of new drugs. 
One important difference between innovation and creativity is that innovation typically involves more than one person. In order to create something new, you need to come up with a solution that meets the needs of your audience and is unique to them. On the other hand, creativity often comes from within- people working on their own projects without any outside help. This type of creativity often produces more original ideas and products than those developed in collaboration.

History of Invention: How did inventions come about?
Invention ideas come about in many different ways. Sometimes, people think of ideas when they are faced with a problem they don't know how to solve. Other times, people work on an idea for awhile and then decide to make it a reality. Innovation is often the result of both these things.
