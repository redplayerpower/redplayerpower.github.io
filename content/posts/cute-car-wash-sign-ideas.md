Types of creative art: There are three main types of creative art: painting, sculpture, and television.
Creative art is anything that leads to new ideas, whether it’s creating new products, learning about new cultures, or just making something yourself. There are three main types of creative art: painting, sculpture, and television. Here are eight examples of creative art that can be used in your own artwork or projects: 
1. Sculpture: sculptures can be used to represent different concepts or objects in a realistic way. For example, the Statue of Liberty could be represented by a beautiful model with details and textures that represent the statue’s iconic design. 
2. Painting: paintings can be used to capture moments or emotions in a candid way. For example, if you were painting a portrait of someone you know, you might use colorful and lively scenes to show how the person looks before and after their experience with creativity.

Discussion: How can we find and use the best ideas for our goals?
If you're like most people, you have some goals that you want to achieve. However, what do you do with the ideas for achieving those goals? 
There are a lot of ways to find and use the best ideas for your goals, but here are four that may be particularly helpful: 

1) Look at what others have accomplished - This is probably the simplest way to find good ideas, as it's all around us. When looking at what others have done, ask yourself how could you perform better or accomplish more of the same? What was their goal? What did they do to achieve it? You'll likely find a lot of great ideas in this category. 
2) Brainstorm - Brainstorming is another great way to come up with new ideas. Again, ask yourself why something might be an effective approach or solution.
