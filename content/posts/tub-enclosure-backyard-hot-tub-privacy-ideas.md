What should you do with your idea?
Ideas are always a valuable commodity, but there are a few things to keep in mind when it comes to how to use them. Here are a few tips: 
1. Get started: It’s always important to get started with an idea, especially if it’s something you want to pursue for a long period of time. You won’t be able to think of anything else while your idea is simmering in your brain.

2. Come up with a solid plan: Once you have your idea, it’s important that you come up with a plan for taking it seriously. This will include figuring out what you want to achieve with your idea, what resources you need (time and money), and who you want to reach out to first (clients or potential customers).
