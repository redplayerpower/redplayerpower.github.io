Conclusion: Some ways to overcome the challenges associated with implementing big ideas.
Introduction
Big ideas are always a challenge, but they can be overcome with the right planning and execution. Here are a few tips to help you get started:

1. Take the time to do your research: big ideas often come with a lot of unknowns and potential challenges. Start by doing some basic research on the topic before coming up with any ideas. This will help you understand what challenges you might face and how best to tackle them.

2. Be prepared to fight for your ideas: big ideas often require a lot of work and effort, even if it's just starting out. Don't be afraid to put in the extra elbow grease – it'll definitely pay off in the end!

3. Be persistent: once you've nailed down some key aspects of your idea, keep pushing until you're ready to submit it to anyone who will listen.
