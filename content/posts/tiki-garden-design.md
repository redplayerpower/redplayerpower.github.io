Invention ideas: How to come up with new ideas?
There are countless ways to come up with new ideas, but one of the most effective methods is to brainstorm. By Brainstorming, you can come up with a number of different ideas that could potentially be turned into a successful product or business idea. Here are a few tips on how to brainstorm:
1. Start by thinking about what you know and what others have done. This will help you come up with ideas that are based on your experience and knowledge rather than on something that you think might be impossible.

2. Be open to new ideas and don’t be afraid to challenge yourself. If an idea sounds interesting, go ahead and pitch it to someone who might be willing to invest in it.

3. Be patient and don’t hurry things.
