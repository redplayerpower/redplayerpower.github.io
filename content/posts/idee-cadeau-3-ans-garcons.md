What is brainstroming and why is it effective?
Brainstroming is a cognitive stimulation technique that has been used for centuries to improve focus, memory, and thought processes. While there are many different ways to use brainstroming, the most common application is called the “six windows of awareness” Technique. This approach provides individuals with six specific windows of focus in which they can engage in focused thought. The windows of awareness can be found at different points in your mind, depending on what you are thinking or studying.
