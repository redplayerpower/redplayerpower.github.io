Conclusion: What are the implications of innovation for business?
Invention has been the backbone of business for centuries. When something is new, businesses can capitalize on it to increase sales and create new products or services. However, recent innovations have created new challenges for businesses as they try to keep up with the technology. For example, Apple's iPhone has made phone texting and talking on the go a must-have feature for many people. However, this has also led to increased competition in the market as text messaging companies such as WhatsApp and Viber offer better rates and features for their users. Additionally, Google's Chromebook computer is revolutionizing educational resources by making them more accessible online. These are just a few examples of how innovation can impact businesses in different ways.

How is innovation used in the business world?
Innovation is a key component of business success, as it can help businesses improve their products or services, increase sales, and even create new markets. However, it can also be challenging to manage innovation effectively, which is why companies often rely on outside experts to help them work on projects. 
While there are many different ways that innovation is used in the business world, three main methods are structural, process, and product/service system innovations. Structural innovations help businesses change their symbols or branding to create a new standard in the industry. Process innovations can make it easier for customers to order or buy products online or through phone calls. Product/service system innovations can allow companies to improve the overall efficiency of their operations by making changes to their entire supply chain.
