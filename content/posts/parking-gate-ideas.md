How to create a big idea: The steps involved

What makes a big idea: originality, simplicity, and the ability to provoke change
When it comes to big ideas, there are three key elements that make them truly great: originality, simplicity, and the ability to provoke change. Without these essential ingredients, an idea is simply not going to have the impact or staying power that it needs to be truly successful.
 Originality is key because it allows an idea to stand out from everything else that’s already out there. If an idea is too similar to something else, it’s not going to make much of a splash. But if it’s completely new and different, people will take notice and want to learn more about it.

Simplicity is also important because it makes an idea easy to understand and remember. If an idea is too complex, people will quickly lose interest and move on to something else.

2) Better coordination of services through better integration
One way to improve coordination of services is through better integration. This can be done by creating a single system that helps manage all the services offered, or by combining different systems into a single platform. Another idea is to create a clearinghouse for information on health and social services. This would allow users to find the right service and compare prices quickly.
