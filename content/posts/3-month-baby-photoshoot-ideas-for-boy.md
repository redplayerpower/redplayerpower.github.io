Ideas can be a great resource for problem solving and creativity. However, they can also be a powerful tool for blocking out distractions and focusing on the solution. Here are some tips to use your ideas effectively:
1.Think about what you want your idea to achieve. When you come up with an idea, try to think about what it could help achieve. This will help you focus on the task at hand and avoid getting lost in your thoughts.

3.Be realistic about how much time it will take to get your idea off the ground.
