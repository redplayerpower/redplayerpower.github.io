Definition of creativity: What does it mean for a person to be creative?
Creativity is defined in many ways, but at its root it is the ability to come up with new ideas and concepts that have never been thought of before. Whether it’s coming up with a new way to do something or coming up with a way to improve an existing product, creativity is always a huge part of any individual’s life. Some may say that creativity is having a good imagination, while others may say that creativity comes from the ability to think outside the box. In any case, being creative is definitely something everyone should have in their arsenal if they want to be successful in life.
