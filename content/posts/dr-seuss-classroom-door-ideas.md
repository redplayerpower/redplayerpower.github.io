Innovation is a recurrent theme in our lives. It’s what makes us different from the other animals and it’s what makes us unique. Sometimes innovation is what we take for granted, like when we build things from scratch or when we come up with a new way to do something. Other times, innovation comes from what we make, like when we create new products or services.

The different types of ideas
Ideas can be classified by how they are approached. There are three main types of ideas: problem, solution, and goal. Problem ideas come up with a unique solution that solves the problem at hand. Solution ideas come up with a new way of doing something that solves the problem, but may not be what was originally proposed. Goal ideas are the final solution to a problem or goal. They come up with a specific plan or destination that is aimed at getting somewhere else.

What are some creative ideas?
There are endless creative ideas to come up with, and the best way to find them is by brainstorming with a group of people. Here are eight creative ways to spark your imagination: 
1. Start a blog and write about anything that crosses your mind. This can be your personal thoughts or something you read in the news. You don’t have to be perfect – just share what’s on your mind!

2. Draw inspiration from nature and start painting scenes from around town or in your backyard. Add some animal characters for added fun!

3. Get organized and make a list of all the things you want to do before you die (or at least before you retire). Once you have a complete list, it will be easier to prioritize what’s most important.
