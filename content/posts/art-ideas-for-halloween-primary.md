How to get started with creative art
Creative art is a great way to express yourself and can be very therapeutic. It can be daunting to know where to start, but there are some easy ways to get started with creative art.
One way to get started is by doing some research online or in books about different artists and styles that you like. This can give you some ideas about what kind of art you would like to create. Another way to get started is by experimenting with different mediums and techniques until you find something that you enjoy.

brain washing: How can people be made to do things they don't want to do?
How can people be made to do things they don't want to do? There are many ways, but some of the most common methods are brainwashing and suggestion. Brainwashing is a process of inducing someone to change their views or behavior by using persuasive techniques. suggesting someone does something based on their eagerness or attraction often works better than actual coercion. Brainwashing techniques typically range from subtle (like reinforcing positive thoughts) to blatant (such as convincing someone that they have no choice in the matter). 
There are a few different types of brainwashing, but the most common is suggestion. Suggestion is when you say something that might make someone do something they wouldn't normally do. For example, if you tell a person they have to go outside for 5 minutes, that might suggest to them that it's time for them to get up and leave.
