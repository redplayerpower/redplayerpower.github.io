Invention: How does invention change the world?
Invention has changed the way we live and work, and it could soon change the world again. With new methods of technology coming up every day, it’s hard to predict how innovation will impact our lives in the future. But with some careful planning, there is no doubt that invention will have a large impact on society as a whole. 
For example, imagine a world where cars were not relying on gasoline or oil to run. Instead, they would be powered by electricity or wind energy. This would slash fuel costs and improve air quality around the world. 

Similarly, imagine a world without farm animals. We would be able to produce more food without them and reduce water usage because we wouldn’t need to pour water onto fields just to get food for our animals. 

 Invention could also have an even larger impact on our planet.

Origin of invention: Why was a particular invention chosen for development?
Inventions are often chosen for development based on a number of factors, including need, potential market, and other costs. There is an Origin of Invention story to be told every time a new invention is created. The story begins with the idea and then the process that went into making it a reality. 
Some inventions are born out of necessity; others come from pure thought. Sometimes, an idea just pops into someone's head and they start to see how it could be used in the real world. Other times, a team of experts put their thoughts together and come up with a great solution or innovation.
