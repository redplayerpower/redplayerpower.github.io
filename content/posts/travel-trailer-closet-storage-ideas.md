What are the benefits of having ideas?
Ideas are a powerful tool that can help you get things done. Whether you have them all ready-made or you come up with them on your own, having ideas will help make your work more efficient and effective. Here are three benefits of having ideas: 
1. You’ll be able to come up with new solutions to problems faster. If you don’t have any ideas, you’ll likely spend hours looking for the same old solutions, which won’t get the job done. Having a few good ideas will provide you with a better understanding of how the problem could be solved and a way to go about solving it quickly. 
2. You’ll be able to take what you know and put it into practice.

The Invention of the Telephone
In 1876, Samuel Morse and Alfred Vail developed a signaling system that could be used to send messages over the air. This system, called the telegraph, allowed for communication between distant locations without having to rely on intermediaries. The telephone was created in 1877, when inventor John Ambrose Fleming developed a technology that allowed voice calls over the telephone line. The telephone was an incredibly important invention, not just because it allowed people to communicate with each other more efficiently, but also because it made communication possible from far away.
