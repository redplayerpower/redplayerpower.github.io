Ideas: How can we use new ideas toOur lives?
There are so many new ideas out there that it can be hard to know where to start. Here are a few ideas to get you started: 
-Start with a problem. What do you need more of? More money? More love? Something in between? When you start thinking about things this way, you'll be more likely to come up with ideas for addressing your needs in new and innovative ways. 
-Think outside the box. What if there was a way to use something that's usually used for something else? For example, think about using recycled materials in architecture. You could create unique, sustainable structures with ease! 
-Consider your own needs first. What do you need more of in life than money or love? After all, those two things are obviously necessary for most people. But what do you really need in order to feel fulfilled and happy?

What is big ideas?
Ideas are important, but they can also be dangerous. Big ideas can be so big that they become irrelevant or unimportant, and can lead to nothing more than indifference or a lack of interest in what a person has to say. But there are certain things that make for great ideas, and those things vary depending on the person. Some great examples of big ideas are:1) A new way of looking at life – This could be anything from simplifying complex concepts to coming up with a new perspective on old injustices.2) A new way of doing business – This could involve starting a company, working on a project with others, or making a change in the way people live.3) A new way of thinking about the world – This could be anything from exploring different perspectives to proposing a new perspective on an existing doctrine.

What is innovation?
Innovation is the act of coming up with a new and original idea or approach to something. It can be anything from a new product or service to an innovative way of running a business. There are many types of innovation, but some are more popular than others. Here are four examples:
1. Creative invention – This type of innovation comes from coming up with an original solution to a problem that someone else had before you. This can be something as simple as creating a new type of bread recipe or developing a way to cut costs in your business.

2. Collective intelligence – This is when two or more people come up with an idea for solving a common problem and then work together to make it happen. This can be something as simple as coming up with a better way to stock shelves or finding new ways to sell products.
