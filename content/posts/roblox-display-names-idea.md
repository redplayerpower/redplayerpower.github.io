The dangers of not being creative: What can go wrong if you don't focus on your potential?
Creativity is one of the most important qualities you can have in your life. It allows you to see new possibilities and come up with ideas that no one else could have thought of. However, if you don't focus on your potential, you can easily go wrong. Here are a few examples: 
1) You might not be able to come up with big ideas because you're not inspired by other people or things. 
2) You might not be able to come up with ideas that are unique or interesting because nobody has ever done them before. 
3) You might not be able to come up with great ideas because you're too timid or scared to try something new. 
4) You might not be able to come up with great ideas because your mind is too concentrated on detail instead of taking a broader view.

What are big ideas?
There are always big ideas out there, and it can be tough to come up with the perfect one. Here are four tips on how to come up with the best ideas: 
1. Brainstorm with others. Collaborating is key when coming up with big ideas. Talk to people who have experience in the area you want to explore and see what they think would make for an interesting solution. 
2. Avoid clichés. When coming up with big ideas, be mindful of clichés and other tired patterns that have been done before. Are there other ways to approach this problem that haven’t been considered? What new angles could you take into consideration? 
3. Be open to feedback. Don’t be afraid to ask your friends and family for their opinion on your ideas before you EVEN start thinking about putting them together!
