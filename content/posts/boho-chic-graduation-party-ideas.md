What are some of the best ways to make your home easier and more comfortable?
No matter how much you may think you know about home improvement, there are still some ways to make your life easier and more comfortable without any professional help. Here are a few ideas to get started: 
1) Add comfortable sofas and chairs to your living room. These can be easily made from old furniture or purchased at a garage sale. Be sure to choose a style that is both modern and comfortable. 
2) Create an area for yourself in the center of your home where you can relax and watch TV or read a book. This could be an easily accessible spot with plenty of storage if desired. 
3) Repair or update outdated windows or doorframes. If they are in need of repair, do it yourself without any professional help! It’s also easy to find new materials and components online if needed.

The future of food: How will we consume food in the future?
The future of food is still in question, but some ideas that have been floated include: 1) meal delivery services such as Uber and Deliveroo; 2) eating out less often; and 3) growing more of our food in the home. 
While these are all plausible options, there is also the potential for even more niche or Sustainable eaters to emerge, who will only consume sustainable or earth-friendly products. So what does this mean for consumers? 

When it comes to food, it means looking out for not just sustainability but also flavor. If you want your food to taste good, it needs to be nutritious and fresh. Fresh produce tastes better and is more refreshing on the palate, so if you can find earth-friendly or sustainable options that do both, go for it!
