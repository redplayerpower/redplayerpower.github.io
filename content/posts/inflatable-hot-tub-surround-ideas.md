Inspiration: How does one getInspiration for their work?
Creativity is a vital part of any work. Without creativity, there would be no point to starting a project and wouldn't be anything to look forward to during the process. However, getting inspiration for one's work can be difficult. There are many ways to get inspiration, but it all comes down to finding what works for you and your personal style. Here are some tips on how to get inspired for your next project: 
1) Take breaks throughout the day: A break can help you re-evaluate what you're working on and whether it's something that's inspiring or not. Sometimes taking a step back will give you new perspective that'll spark new ideas. 
2) Be open to suggestions: If you don't have any ideas of your own, sometimes talking with other creatives or reading articles or watching videos will help you develop new ideas.
