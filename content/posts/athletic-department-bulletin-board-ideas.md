Conclusion: Ideas are the lifeblood of progress
Ideas are the lifeblood of progress. Without them, we would be stuck in the same place, doing the same things, day in and day out. Ideas help us to see things in new ways, to find new solutions to old problems, and to keep moving forward.
There are a few key things to keep in mind when coming up with ideas:

1. Be open-minded. Be willing to consider all possibilities, no matter how far-fetched they may seem at first.

2. Take inspiration from others. Look at what others have done and see how you can build on their ideas or take them in a new direction.

3. Donâ€™t be afraid to experiment. Try out different approaches and see what works best for you.

How innovation benefits society:
Innovation benefits society by increasing productivity, innovation reducing costs, and improving the quality of products. Productivity is the amount of work done per hour. Reducing costs is the lowering of prices or the reduction in cost of producing a good or service. Improving quality is the improvement of something that does not meet all expectations, for example a product that is not as effective as it should be. Innovation can be thought of as any change in how something is done, from making a new product to changing how services are provided.
