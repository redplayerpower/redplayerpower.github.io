What are the benefits of using ideas?
Ideas are a powerful tool that can help you achieve your goals. By using them, you can improve your thinking process and come up with new ideas that may be more effective than the ones you’ve been using before. Here are six benefits of using ideas: 
1. More efficient thought: When you have a lot of ideas to think about, it becomes easier to come up with good solutions. This makes problem solving more efficient and faster, which is important for any business or project. 
2. More creativity: Ideas are often more creative than what you’ve been used to before. This is because they deal with new solutions and possibilities rather than just following the same path someone else has already taken.

Why we need big ideas
In a world that is constantly moving and changing, it is more important than ever to have big ideas. Big ideas are what drive progress and keep us moving forward. They inspire us to think outside the box and come up with solutions to problems that we never thought possible.

So why do we need big ideas? Because they are what make the world go round. They are what keep us moving forward and progressing as a society. With out them, we would be lost.

The main points of the article
1. Ideas can be put into many different categories, but the three most common are: problems, solutions, and potential solutions.
2. Solutions to problems are often the easiest to find, and often have obvious solutions. However, there may be multiple possible solutions that fit the problem and still meet the goals of the solution.

3. Potential solutions are more difficult to determine, but can provide a more complete or accurate solution than either a solution or a problem. They can also be less likely to cause further problems down the road.
