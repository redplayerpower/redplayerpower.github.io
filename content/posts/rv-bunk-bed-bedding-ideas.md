What are some creative ideas for businesses?
Creative ideas for businesses can be anything from a new way to market your product or service, to a new idea for how you can improve your business. Whatever the creative idea, there are some things you can do to make it work. Here are some tips: 
1. Make sure your creative ideas are realistic. Don’t try to come up with something that might not be possible or will not work in the real world. When you’re creating your ideas, think about what could really happen and how they could benefit your business. 
2. Get feedback before starting anything. Before starting any creative project, get input from people who know what they’re talking about and have experience with the type of product or service you’re thinking of marketing.
