Layout: How can you make your living space more organized and comfortable?
Organizing your home can help you feel more comfortable and organized. There are many ways to do this, so find one that works best for you. Here are some ideas:
-Start by taking a look at what is already in your home and take down anything that isn't necessary. This will make room for new things and make your living space more organized.

-Create a basic organizational system for your home with drawers, shelves, boxes, and folders. You can use these to store clothes, tools, or other belongings.

-Expand the idea of organization by adding another level of complexity. For example, you could add removable dividers between rooms or add built-in shelving to main walls. This will give your living space more depth and organization without costing a lot of money.

Brainstorming with a team
1. When it comes to brainstorming with a team, there are a few things to keep in mind.
2. First and foremost, it’s important to create an environment where everyone feels comfortable sharing their ideas. This means no judgement or criticism – just open-mindedness and respect for others’ opinions.
