The Creative Process: How do we come up with new ideas?
Creativity is a process. It's not just a matter of coming up with new ideas. The creative process goes deeper than that. It's about how we come up with new ideas, and what we do to help ourselves get there.
There are different ways to approach creativity. Some people use brainstorming or problem-solving methods to come up with new ideas. Others rely on creative visualization or brainstorming techniques known as “brainstormsing.”

Whatever way you go, it's important to remember that creativity comes from the heart. We need to be open and allow ourselves to be inspired by what we see and hear around us. When we're able to let go of our habitual ways of thinking, we can start to create something new and amazing.

Memory exercise: How can we improve our memory and concentration?
Memory is an important skill that we can use to improve our concentration and memory. Here are some ways to improve our memory:
1. Eat a balanced diet with plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. These foods help to create a strong immune system and keep our brains healthy.

2. Get enough exercise. Exercise has been shown to improve cognitive function and mental clarity.

3. Use brain teasers or mental puzzles to keep your mind active and engaged. Brain teasing tasks include things like finding the pattern in a jumble of numbers, solving complex math problems, or making decision trees.

4. Practice gratitude every day for all the good in our lives. Gratitude can boost mood, focus, and creativity; it can also help us remember positive experiences from past times.
