The history of innovation: Why has it been so important in human history?
Innovation has been one of the most important aspects of human history, reliably helping to make our lives better. But what exactly is innovation? And how has it been so important in human history?
Innovation, as we understand it today, comes from creating new and improved ways of doing things. It can be something as simple as a new way to produce food or a better way to process oil. However, innovation can also include more complex ideas, like coming up with a new way to use energy or developing a new type of locomotive.

What makes innovation so important is that it often leads to improvements in people’s lives.

The Process of Being Creative
When it comes to creative ideas, the process can be a bit mysterious. Where do they come from? How can you get more of them? While there's no one answer to these questions, there are some things you can do to increase your chances of having a great idea.
First, make sure you're exposing yourself to new things. Ideas often come from seeing something in a new way or combining two disparate things. If you're stuck in the same old routine, it'll be harder to have those "a-ha!" moments.

 Second, give yourself time and space to daydream. Once you have an idea, it's important to let it percolate for a while before taking action on it. Often, the best ideas come when you're not actively trying to think of one.

Finally, don't be afraid to experiment and take risks.
