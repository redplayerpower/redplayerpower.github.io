Origin of invention: Why was a particular invention chosen for development?
Inventions are often chosen for development based on a number of factors, including need, potential market, and other costs. There is an Origin of Invention story to be told every time a new invention is created. The story begins with the idea and then the process that went into making it a reality. 
Some inventions are born out of necessity; others come from pure thought. Sometimes, an idea just pops into someone's head and they start to see how it could be used in the real world. Other times, a team of experts put their thoughts together and come up with a great solution or innovation. 

The Origin of Invention story isn't always about bricks and mortar. Sometimes, ideas just take off in different directions after being studied and tested in various settings.

How can you create a compelling value proposition?
Creating a compelling value proposition is a critical part of any business. By understanding and addressing the needs of your target audience, you can create a product or service that offers value to customers. Here are four pieces of advice to help you create a solid value proposition:
1)Clarify what your product or service does that others don't. Define what your customers need and want, and make sure your offer encompasses this. If they don't know what it is, they're likely not going to want it.
2)Know who your target market is. A good way to identify this is by doing market research on yourself or your competition. Understand the unique needs of your target market and craft your value proposition around these goals.
3)Make sure the price is fair.

The Future of Invention: There is an active field of research that is exploring the potential of new technologies and how they could impact future generations.
Innovation is a constantly occurring event in the life of humans and technology. It has been a driving force in human progress for centuries and will continue to do so into the future. There are a number of potential new technologies that could have a significant impact on society and the economy. 
One potential technology that has the potential to revolutionize how we do business is artificial intelligence (AI). AI is able to learn and grow on its own, making it more efficient and accurate at performing tasks. This could have a significant impact on businesses, as it would make it easier to automate processes and reduce costs. 

Another potential technology that has the potential to have a significant impact on society is blockchain technology. Blockchain is a distributed database that allows for secure transactions between parties without middlemen. This could have implications for many industries, including business, finance, and law.
