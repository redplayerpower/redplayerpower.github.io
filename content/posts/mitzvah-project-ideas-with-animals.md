Conclusion: Ideas are the lifeblood of progress
Ideas are the lifeblood of progress. Without them, we would be stuck in the same place, doing the same things, day in and day out. Ideas help us to see things in new ways, to find new solutions to old problems, and to keep moving forward.
There are a few key things to keep in mind when coming up with ideas:

1. Be open-minded. Be willing to consider all possibilities, no matter how far-fetched they may seem at first.

2. Take inspiration from others. Look at what others have done and see how you can build on their ideas or take them in a new direction.

3. Donâ€™t be afraid to experiment. Try out different approaches and see what works best for you.

Types of creativity: Intuitive, logical, creative, and gestural
Creativity is a highly subjective term that can be defined in many ways. Some might say that creativity is the ability to come up with new ideas, while others might say that creativity is simply making something new. Whatever definition one chooses, there are some key elements to creative thinking which are all based on intuition. Intuitive thinking often comes from the subconscious and is not based on logical thought processes. This makes it much more difficult to control, but can also be very effective in solving problems or creating solutions.
