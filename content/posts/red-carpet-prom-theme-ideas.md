The Importance of Innovation in the Economy: What are some benefits to businesses that embrace innovation?

It also helps businesses to keep up with changes in technology and to stay competitive against other companies. Some benefits of innovation include: 
- Increased sales - When a business embraces innovation, it can get its products and services into more people's hands. This means that more people can buy them, which in turn leads to increased profits. 
- Improved efficiency - Innovation allows businesses to use less manpower and resources, which can save money on costs. 
- Increased productivity - By embracing innovation, businesses can maintain or increase their output levels. This in turn leads to increasedemployment and a higher quality of life for those who live near or work for these businesses.
